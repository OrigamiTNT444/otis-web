weekday -- my dorm has a lot of rly funny, cool, and unhinged ppl\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*] camping at Joshua Tree national park with my dorm. i also tried out bouldering and did pretty badly because im kinda short and hence kinda bad at climbing up things, but it was rly fun and the view at the top was awesome\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*] dropping pumpkins frozen in LN2 from the roof of a 9 story building on halloween\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*] playing hide and seek around campus during another dorm\u0026#039;s party where the boundaries of hiding shrunk around the party house\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*] \u0026quot;zombie night\u0026quot; last weekend, which was basically: my dorm built barricades in our dorm out of wood\/rope\/zipties and another dorm dressed up as zombies and tried to break in with non-sharp tools and their bare hands; it was sooo fun... \u003Cstrike\u003Esome doors and ceiling drywall were broken\u003C\/strike\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n[\/list]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\noverall i am so much happier than in high school. having freedom and being surrounded by amazing ppl 24\/7 is just so great.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbtw i think my sleep schedule has been approximately 12:45-8:15 every day so like fine i guess... i can\u0026#039;t even comprehend going to bed at 10 anymore though, that feels insanely early\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003Eok i should actually lock in right now i\u0026#039;m kinda screwed i need to learn a math topic for CMM power round and do my putnam seminar hw and go to putnam seminar class and do a physics quiz this weekend (our quizzes are take-home) and probably also start reading my math 108a lecture notes and i SHOULD also start working on my math 5a, physics, and math 108a homework assignments which are due next wednesday because otherwise ill be screwed tuesday-wednesday and... oh shoot i also have a chem homework assignment due tomorrow\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ni think math 108a is actually going to be the death of me these next few days though because i have like 8 pages of lecture notes to read and i read at a speed of like half an hour per page if im actually focused\u003Cbr\u003E\ni am genuinely so scared, i hope i survive this class\u003Cbr\u003E\noh well if things actually start getting worse i\u0026#039;ll have to ask ppl for help which is fine i guess, i\u0026#039;ll just have to spend even more time on it\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ni\u0026#039;m not sure when i\u0026#039;ll next be able to post but possibly over thanksgiving break and most

rly interesting because there are like no cliques here when the freshmen first come because barely anyone knows each other previously, so for the first like week ppl just mingle and are pretty open to talking to other ppl they haven\u0026#039;t heard of before. i think friend groups and cliques will eventually form though, and they\u0026#039;re already kinda starting to form among the athletes

			<div class="message">im not sure why but this is like the least busy i've been in WEEKS and it's right before finals week... i still have quite a few things to do right now but i think i have time to write a post<br>
i have one week left of the trimester and its just take-home finals; no classes<br>
<br>
putnam was yesterday. it was interesting. i don't exactly think i'm allowed to talk about it. i wish i could tho<br>
<br>
overall i have been having an amazing trimester... i'm kinda lazy so i'll just use bullet points
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>i love my house (well, most of the time.) there are so many kind and funny and approachable ppl, very different from the ppl i interacted with in high school but i honestly think this is a lot healthier of a community</li>
<li>i loved math 5a (abstract algebra). i think i already wrote about this in a previous post but it was a very interesting class, i learned a ton, and the prof is so passionate about helping us understand the material, even to a deeper level than what the course was supposed to cover</li>
<li>i think the workload was just barely doable. i definitely took advantage of physics and chemistry being pass/fail though; if i had to worry about not getting an A on those then i would be so much more cooked and it would NOT have been doable. (i'm probably not getting A's on both physics and chemistry). i think if i get more efficient at managing time in the future (and like reading lecture notes / textbooks more quickly) then i'll be able to get work done quicker and then this level of workload will be very doable. i was able to get 7-8 hours of sleep a day and socialize at least 6/7 days of the week (usually only for several hours a day tho). i think i spent about 10-11 hours a day (including weekends) on classes and homework for the last few weeks.</li>
<li>wait my last post was before thanksgiving break? wowww... thanksgiving was actually busier than expected; i spent quite a while making food with the ppl in my dorm (i helped to make dumplings and then we made rly cursed dumplings with the extra skin, with fillings such as a whole garlic clove / mac n cheese sauce / pieces of apple / etc.) we also played some improv game during thanksgiving weekend.</li>
<li>i experimented with pulling an all-nighter (and not sleeping for 39 hours straight) a few days ago because upperclassmen pranked the freshmen by telling us that there was an event the next day which would take the entire day, so i did homework during the night, but it ended up only taking a few hours and not the whole day... the morning after the all-nighter was like the most energetic i've ever felt at caltech though, probably because i was on 4 cups of coffee <span style="white-space:pre;">:<img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/b/0/7b0bf971e21d8f422a0b0d0a09c91d174924267c.png" class="latex" alt="$   $" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="2" height="2">D</span> that was an interesting feeling</li>
<li>i drank coffee very minimally, only when i didn't get enough sleep. i found that plain black coffee actually tastes <i>really good</i> though, but it does sometimes give me a stomachache if i drink too much of it at once lol</li>
<li>i cold-emailed professors about research stuff and found that a lot of them don't actually bite</li>
<li>after taking intro physics, intro chem, and some college math, and interacting with people in my dorm and stuff, i think i've gained a lot more respect for science in general. when people talked about a science topic which i knew nothing about, i used to kinda tune out because i thought i had no hope of understanding any of it. i still have little hope in most cases, but it's interesting that quite a bit of science reduces down to basic math concepts like differential equations and geometry that i can more easily wrap my brain around. okay i'm just yapping but interacting with ppl who do non-math science has made me respect non-math science a lot more. math is cool and all but so are other science subjects <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></li>
<li>math 108a isn't that hard, i just have a reading comprehension skill issue (like i read math textbooks and lecture notes reallyyyy slowly). i'm also not very good at analysis.</li>
<li>i attended all the lectures for math 5a (my favorite class), all but one for math 108a (the one was because i was rly busy or smth), none of the lectures for physics since they conflicted with math 108a but all of the recitations, all of the lectures for chemistry and some of the recitations, and all of the humanities classes because attendance is mandatory for those (attendance is not mandatory for the others)</li>
<li>i discovered kpop (im very late i know) and had like a week-long IVE phase lmao... some kpop songs are actually pretty good and very energizing</li>
<li>i found that i don't actually like instant ramen that much LMAO but also open kitchen usually exists so i can usually just get cold breakfast food from the dorm kitchen if i want</li>
<li>i opened a bank account! i also figured out how to pay for stuff using paypal. so now i can pay for stuff (well only some stuff that can be bought online) using my own money, not my parents' money, which feels soooo much better -- i used to feel so bad about buying anything even if it was like $10 because it was out of my parents' account (i basically put any money i earned in my parents' account before)</li>
<li>i've gotten more confident and social <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> well comparing with senior year of high school is kinda bad because senior year was pretty bad for me emotionally. but in general, i have been MUCH happier and (mentally) healthier in college <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> being surrounded by amazing ppl really helps, and having freedom to make basically all of my own decisions is actually wonderful</li>
</ul>
<br>
i'm going to take my math 5a final tomorrow and then do my math 108a final the day after (that one is unlimited time in a 24 hour period) and then physics/chem/humanities in the last 2 days. it will not be easy but just barely doable hopefully <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
also, i'm almost definitely going to create a blog on a different website (probably substack or medium) over winter break. i'm not really sure yet what the purpose of it will be (keeping note of my introspective thoughts / documenting my life / telling others about my life / etc) -- the purpose will probably be slightly different than what this blog has been since i expect much fewer ppl to read the new blog but idk<br>
<br>
hopefully i'll be able to post some higher quality stuff during winter break!<br>
<br>
thanks yall for reading <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">ive been sooooooo busy sorry guys LMAO<br>
it has been so fun tho<br>1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a
can't believe its already more than halfway through the term (caltech does trimesters)<br>
i barely survived midterms!!<br>
<br>
saturday is a little less busy than other days so i guess i'll post<br>
<br>
it just keeps getting busier XD i pretty much do classes + homework from 9am-11pm every day (with breaks for like meals and checking messages and stuff) i used to be able to actually do random stuff (like random putnam problems) and then i had a few days a week to grind less hard like (like thurs-fri since most of my assignments are due on wednesdays) but now i have essays / extra credit due on fridays sometimes and there's just no time to take a break lmao<br>
<br>
there's one class in particular that's kinda screwing me over the most; math 108a, classical analysis. it's supposed to be a sophomore math major class but someone encouraged me to take it in freshman year cuz then i can do research sooner or smth. its similar to hs/oly algebra, in that it's continuous and not discrete, and this is just not my math strength at all. its so easy to fakesolve problems because i can't really picture what's happening in my mind (its easier to do this with euclidean geometry and discrete math). like i'd think that a function or set has to satisfy a certain property but there's just a counterexample. ngl i am becoming more and more lost in this class but i am like barely holding on (i think i have a borderline A) (if i dont get an A then im actually very screwed) like i kinda have no idea what's going on right now but i guess i'll read the lecture notes before the next assignment is due (next wednesday)<br>
<i>but reading lecture notes takes so long</i><br>
the lecture notes is basically 30 billion theorems which all require some very specific conditions to hold in order to apply them, but when u can apply them it's like magic and they basically nuke the problem. solving the problems is basically like playing a game of "which theorem should i apply" :/<br>
<br>
my other math class, math 5a, abstract algebra, is absolutely amazing. i love EVERYTHING about that class. the problems feel kinda like oly nt/combo which is so awesome. the problems feel like puzzles that you have to hack away at with different tools until you discover more and more about how they work (often times what the structure of the group is). i love the prof and the problems remind me of oly (in a good way). this class is my earliest class (9-9:55am) but i'd wake up any day to go to it. it often goes at least 5 minutes overtime because everyone is having so much fun in the class, including the prof. i love it so much. i'm going to miss this class so much after it's over.<br>
<br>
my other classes (intro physics, intro chem, humanities, and putnam seminar if that even counts as a class) are okay... i unfortunately can't attend physics lectures since it conflicts with my math 108a lectures so that kinda sucks. i'm kinda bad at physics but it's really interesting.<br>
<br>
i think i rly need to get better at learning from textbooks/lecture notes because in the future i'm going to have to do a lot of self-studying instead of like learning from going to class.<br>
<br>
oh btw most freshmen are on pass/fail for all of their classes but i'm taking math 5a and math 108a on grades because they aren't "freshman core classes" so thats a little scary. tbh everything is fine except for math 108a ahhhhhhhhh<br>
<br>
also ive been kinda stubborn about working with ppl; most ppl at caltech groupsolve their problem sets (we have like 4-5 problem sets to do every week plus quizzes and essays and stuff) but i'd rather work on my own (unless it's like really close to the deadline and i really need help, which happened like once) because i think i learn better when i spend time banging my head on problems and figuring them out myself<br>
<br>
oh yeah i'm also kinda screwed for the putnam i'm literally gonna fail LOL<br>
<br>
ok aside from academics.... i've been having a LOT of fun when i am able to take a break from academics <span style="white-space:pre;">:<img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/b/0/7b0bf971e21d8f422a0b0d0a09c91d174924267c.png" class="latex" alt="$ $" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="2" height="2">)</span>)) here are some fun things that happened<br>

<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>eating dinner with my dorm every weekday -- my dorm has a lot of rly funny, cool, and unhinged ppl</li>
<li>camping at Joshua Tree national park with my dorm. i also tried out bouldering and did pretty badly because im kinda short and hence kinda bad at climbing up things, but it was rly fun and the view at the top was awesome</li>
<li>dropping pumpkins frozen in LN2 from the roof of a 9 story building on halloween</li>
<li>playing hide and seek around campus during another dorm's party where the boundaries of hiding shrunk around the party house</li>
<li>"zombie night" last weekend, which was basically: my dorm built barricades in our dorm out of wood/rope/zipties and another dorm dressed up as zombies and tried to break in with non-sharp tools and their bare hands; it was sooo fun... <strike>some doors and ceiling drywall were broken</strike></li>
</ul>
<br>
overall i am so much happier than in high school. having freedom and being surrounded by amazing ppl 24/7 is just so great.<br>
<br>
btw i think my sleep schedule has been approximately 12:45-8:15 every day so like fine i guess... i can't even comprehend going to bed at 10 anymore though, that feels insanely early<br>
<br>
<i>ok i should actually lock in right now i'm kinda screwed i need to learn a math topic for CMM power round and do my putnam seminar hw and go to putnam seminar class and do a physics quiz this weekend (our quizzes are take-home) and probably also start reading my math 108a lecture notes and i SHOULD also start working on my math 5a, physics, and math 108a homework assignments which are due next wednesday because otherwise ill be screwed tuesday-wednesday and... oh shoot i also have a chem homework assignment due tomorrow<br>
<br>
i think math 108a is actually going to be the death of me these next few days though because i have like 8 pages of lecture notes to read and i read at a speed of like half an hour per page if im actually focused<br>
i am genuinely so scared, i hope i survive this class<br>
oh well if things actually start getting worse i'll have to ask ppl for help which is fine i guess, i'll just have to spend even more time on it</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
i'm not sure when i'll next be able to post but possibly over thanksgiving break and most definitely over winter break <span style="white-space:pre;">:<img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/b/0/7b0bf971e21d8f422a0b0d0a09c91d174924267c.png" class="latex" alt="$ $" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="2" height="2">)</span></div>

			<div class="message">my first class will start in an hour<br>
it’s abstract algebra and the textbook is dummit foote lol<br>
a lot of my friends are in this class, and one of my very good friends is the TA, and i’ve heard the professor is very good, so i’m very excited lol <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
the past week was orientation during which we basically watched a bunch of presentations and student panels (the latter were actually pretty interesting) and got to explore the different “houses” (dorms) to see which one we might want to live in long-term (we’re moving out of temporary room assignments in about a week)<br>
<br>
each “house” has a different culture and it’s really interesting because some of the houses are more normal, others extremely weird/quirky, some bond as communities over similarities, and some bond by embracing their differences (everyone is just so different from each other and they seem to like that). i think i prefer the second type. each house eats dinner together every day i think, so they are pretty tight-knit communities.<br>
<br>
for the past few days i’ve been groupsolving putnam problems with some other math majors (and also other stuff like playing for the win, laughing at each other, etc.) basically every evening. it’s been really fun and also <i>really</i> entertaining because the other 3 ppl happen to be complete clowns. jk, they can be mature and are <i>really</i> smart, but they can also be clowns (in a good way) <strike>often</strike> sometimes.<br>
<br>
i think after the putnam groupsolves started, i actually feel at home again. it’s nice to just have fun doing math problems and trolling around, and it reminds me of middle and high school but without the competition stress. i think there is generally a big groupsolving culture here, whether it be homework problem sets or random problems for fun.<br>
<br>
people here aren’t really stressed about the putnam <strike>even though someone jokingly said yesterday that he would kill himself if he didn’t get HM</strike> like i know quite a few ppl who are just planning on winging it. but there are several people who are seriously studying (and i feel like i should do that too)<br>
<br>
i’m still deciding between taking math 108 (classical analysis) and cs 1 (an intro cs class); i’m going to go to both today to see how they are. classical analysis will probably be harder than cs 1 so that's why i'm hesitating on taking it, but i’ve heard that it’s really useful if i want to do research next summer, so certain upperclassmen have been strongly encouraging me to take it. basically, i want to take interesting and useful classes but don’t want to die from too much work (cuz i want to still have free time for like putnam and athemath and stuff). at least i have very nice friends who could help me if needed. several of my classes are on pass/fail though because it’s the first 2 terms, like intro physics, intro chem, and a humanities class, so that’s nice<br>
<br>
anyway things have been amazing. i think there’s a decent amount of supernerds (like me) and a good amount of cool nerds (all the rest) here, so basically any type of nerd can fit in.</div>

			<div class="message">actually like better than expected (well i don't really know what i was expecting)<br>
<br>
i actually have like the best roommate ever. she's very nice and is doing MechE and is talkative and open-minded. she sleeps like 10:30-5:30 which is honestly pretty similar to my sleep schedule so that works out well. she goes to the gym in the morning which i don't LOL<br>
<br>
classes haven't started yet so everyone's basically just chilling and socializing a LOT. there are info sessions throughout the day, some of which are rly interesting (basically the ones with student panels) and some of which are more boring (just adults talking). there are quite a few upperclassmen here to like help out with orientation but not everyone (most others are coming today or tomorrow!) they are rly nice and approachable though. literally everyone is so nice.<br>
<br>
i've met many cool people (including like ~8 math majors in my grade?), have like 5-10 pretty good friends, and have talked to probably ~40% of my grade (there are only 220 ppl in the grade). it's rly interesting because there are like no cliques here when the freshmen first come because barely anyone knows each other previously, so for the first like week ppl just mingle and are pretty open to talking to other ppl they haven't heard of before. i think friend groups and cliques will eventually form though, and they're already kinda starting to form among the athletes because they spend so much time practicing together.<br>
but i love how ppl don't know me for my math achievements, they just know me as someone who happens to like math, and so i'm just another normal freshman. there is no invisible barrier accentuated by orz culture like i can kinda sense exists in the math community.<br>
<br>
i still kinda need to learn how to improve my social battery lollll like i can be extraverted for 1-2 hours at a time and then i just can't anymore and become introverted like i naturally am XD<br>
<br>
i'm gonna need to somehow figure out how to be productive though because i spend so much time just chatting with my roommate in my room, or like other friends will ask if i want to go do stuff with them and i'll say yes because i want to make friends and stuff<br>
i can't rly be productive unless i'm alone LOLLL<br>
so far i've been being semi-productive for like a solid one hour every day, 7-8am LMAO cuz my roommate is at the gym<br>
but once classes start, i'll actually have a lot of homework, and will have to do stuff like practicing for Putnam and writing problems for CMM on top of that, so i'll have to like say no to social activities and stuff...<br>
<br>
oh another thing is... i feel a tiny bit spoiled. i've never felt this rich before. (i'm not rich.) there's like always way too much food, nice facilities, free merch... an abundance of stuff in general. i'm not really used to this.<br>
<br>
i also still haven't really come to terms with the fact that i'm actually in college. throughout my whole life i've kinda thought (and my parents have told me) that college is kinda the time of your life, when you basically get to have fun, explore stuff and learn stuff, while not having adult-ish worries. and now that i've reached that stage, four years seems very short. but i guess it <i>is</i> turning out to be as great as was described to be.<br>
and now that i think back, high school was rly hard, like mentally with all the stress and being under parental controls and figuring stuff out etc. i've heard from a lot of ppl that high school was harder than college in this way. so for everyone in high school, don't worry, you'll get through it and experience something very nice on the other side <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

the bed that i’d jump on half-naked when i was 10, and hide Harry Potter books in the cracks of so that my parents wouldn’t know that i was wasting time reading fantasy<br>
the window through which i’ve gazed out on countless pitch-dark mornings at serene blankets of snow that weren’t there the day before, while the radiator below breathed on my legs<br>
the arrangement of beds that my mom changed up every 1-2 years, like dominoes on a 3 by 4 grid<br>
the doorknob that my sister put way too many scrunchies on so that they always fall off and become overstretched<br>
the clock that was once 12 numbers and 2 hands glued to the wall by my mom until they broke off, that was once small and bright red and from Target until it broke, and is now gray and also probably from Target<br>
the overfull hook carrying lanyards i’ve collected from math camps and competitions throughout high school<br>
the ceiling with a few innocuous cracks that i’ve stared at on countless kindergarten afternoons when i was not at all sleepy during my mandatory daily nap<br>
the fan that i don’t recall ever being turned on, with four blades instead of five because my siblings and i accidentally broke one of them<br>
the window panes which were once decorated with cutouts from chinese class vaguely resembling demons’ faces staring into your soul<br>
the glow-in-the-dark sheep sticky-tacked to the wall, which i’ve rarely ever seen actually glow because they have to be recharged in the light and i usually go to sleep after it’s been dark for a while<br>
the door that i’d open just a crack and put my ear to when i was younger so i could hear the CMU gossip my parents discussed at night<br>
the divider that my mom bought when i was going through puberty to create some sort of a dressing room, but that i never used because 1) my siblings didn’t use dressing rooms so i didn’t want to either, and 2) it was cramped, so she eventually gave it away<br>
the shelves and dressers that slowly filled the pockets of empty floor space to store all the random stuff my siblings and i accumulated, but most of which we don’t actually use<br>
the room where my brother and i would talk after being put to bed, despite our increasingly annoyed mom telling us to go to sleep<br>
where i’d go to cry, or when i really badly needed alone time<br>
where i watched my sister grow up, from an infant in a four-walled crib to a toddler in a three-walled crib to a kid in a twin sized bed who is almost as tall as me<br>
where the combination of clocks ticking, crickets chirping, and my siblings snoring made me never feel alone in the depths of night<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
yesterday it hit me that something so normal and part of everyday life would soon become an artifact riddled with meaning; every glimpse like a sugar rush of memories. like Stever House, Bryce Jordan Center, or the mathcounts nationals hotel. something that, rather than fleeting across your mind for a few seconds every day, you end up thinking about for hours on some nights…<br>
<br>
…and not at all on others.</div>

<li>a junior who i didn’t rly know beforehand actually giving me SO MUCH HELPFUL ADVICE (mostly academic) for placement tests and life in general, introducing me to zpordle and spending a lot of time talking to me over the summer and teaching me math -- i now have a MUCH better idea of what to expect due to him</li>

			<div class="message"><i>Once, I had an empire in a golden age<br>
I was held up so high, I used to be great<br>
They used to cheer when they saw my face<br>
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace</i><br>
<br>
i sometimes wonder if choosing Caltech over MIT was the wrong decision. perhaps it implies that i’m not good enough for MIT, too much of a coward to push myself to the limits, or scared of being a little fish in a big pond. perhaps all the parents are laughing at me knowing that their kid will become a rich quant and i won’t. perhaps in a few years they’ll think of me as a high school failure who got rejected from MIT, and my friends from math competitions will forget the fact that i ever existed. in fact, i sometimes wish for a hypercompetitive environment where i’ll have to fight my way to the surface again with so many people around me doing the same thing, kind of like math competitions in middle and high school. i sometimes wish i was able to impress people including myself again, like i was at some point in high school.<br>
maybe there’s a reason why no one else does crazy stuff like this.<br>
<br>
<i>And I feel like my castle's crumbling down<br>
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground<br>
And you don't want to know me<br>
I will just let you down<br>
You don't wanna know me now</i><br>
<br>
i wonder what would’ve happened if i hadn’t sillied that really easy problem (tst p5). if my brain hadn’t completely crashed in the last 5 minutes after realizing that i made a mistake. i still remember that moment in the dean of students’ office, literally feeling the castles crumbling in my head. leaving the room shaking. one small change, and everything could’ve been different. i could actually have gone to events like EGMO 2024, MathFest in Indianapolis, maybe the Jane Street thing… so many opportunities to see my friends again. could i be closer to the MOP community? closer to the math community? closer to my friends?<br>
<br>
i’m actually not that close to the MOP community though. i think the most i can say about why right now is, i put all my eggs in one basket and it… didn’t work. my best friend a year ago is no longer really my friend. and i have other good friends from like 2 years ago, but i feel a little distant from them because 1) i spent too much time with a different person so i kinda neglected them, 2) a lot of them are at MIT, and 3) i’m a different gender so experiences are kinda different<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">actually not many of my MOP friends are the same gender as me which is kinda unfortunate :/ i think i did something wrong <span style="white-space:pre;">:<img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/b/0/7b0bf971e21d8f422a0b0d0a09c91d174924267c.png" class="latex" alt="$   $" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="2" height="2">(</span>(((</div> and i feel like if i tried socializing with a lot of other MIT people, the first thing they’d see me as is my math achievements, because tbh i don’t have achievements other than math, and i don’t want that to be the case. i just want to be one of them.<br>
<br>
orientation is in a couple days and i’m trying to stay optimistic… no like fr i am being very optimistic <span style="white-space:pre;">:<img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/7/b/0/7b0bf971e21d8f422a0b0d0a09c91d174924267c.png" class="latex" alt="$   $" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="2" height="2">)</span>))) i have talked to some of my classmates and they seem like very cool people<br>

			<div class="message"><span class="bbfont-one-five"><i>life update</i></span><br>
<br>
i’m home alone a lot these days<br>
everyone’s at school or at work and i’m just at home<br>
it feels rly weird having all the college kids in the neighborhood be gone but you’re still there… like am i still in high school or smth<br>
i’m not very productive at home alone; i spend too much time on instagram (bruh why did i even get it again i wish i had not) and got re-addicted to taylor swift music. tbh i’m more productive when around other ppl.<br>
this past week has been pretty chill; not much mandatory stuff to do since i had temporarily basically finished athemath work; so i read a little bit of napkin and spent quite a lot of time biking outside and spent too much time on social media :skull:<br>
<br>
i have a tonnnn of stuff to do in these next 9 days tho so i gotta lock in tbh… there’s quite a bit of athemath work to do in this next week, i should rly make sure i have a solid understanding of linear algebra, and technically i should also be writing problems or practicing a bit of oly. and also random things like visiting my high school and taking my driver’s test for the second time (i failed it the first time because i didnt stop for long enough at a stop light :skull: parallel parking is hard fr tho; i only barely passed last time and i’m nervous) and uh packing but that will take 1 day max<br>
<br>
i've noticed that when i watch movies, or visit museums or historical landmarks, it is often somewhat of an eye-opening experience -- i leave with a new perspective on the world, and end up reflecting on my life and often coming to the conclusion that "i need to work harder". especially when i learn about the rest of the world, i realize how many resources i have in comparison and how much potential i'm wasting by not using them. how other people would seize those opportunities for learning right up; make the most out of their days and nights; because they know such things are not to be taken for granted. i need to stop being trapped in my perception of daily life and what i think is "normalcy", because it's not normal.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-one-five"><i>success?</i></span><br>
<br>
every day i get more confused about what success means. when you’re a kid, pretty much the main objective (for a lot of us) is to learn as much as possible. and in particular, to be really good at something. to be the best. because that gives you more opportunities and lets other people know that you exist, or something. and going forward, many people continue in this direction -- trying to learn a lot, take the hardest classes and become the most knowledgeable about something. but is becoming the best at something really the best way to make an impact in general? or are people doing it because it’s a natural extension of what they’ve done in the past, like following a road even as it becomes dark and you can’t see where you’re going?<br>
recently i heard a different perspective, which is (paraphrased):
<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">Quote:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">as the phase of life changes, so should the strategy. the world needs geniuses, but what it needs more is people who can connect problems with solutions, which doesn’t require the highest level of smarts. the people who lead the world today and make the biggest impacts probably can’t solve tons of IMO or IOI problems, but they have a broad enough view of the world, enough knowledge sprinkled across various fields, enough creativity and open-mindedness, and enough friends, that they can create the missing links that the world needs more than anything; apply tools and concepts and connect groups of people in ways that weren’t thought of before. they’re not geniuses, they just have a really big picture of what’s going on.<br>
so really, being “well-rounded” (having knowledge across diverse areas) and networking skills + social awareness become more important than ever when you get older. working on something that requires only pure brainpower like research is a valid path too, and fulfilling for many, but being able to see how everything ties together -- looking down at the city from a plane instead of being trapped on the same one road -- is crucial for directly making a big difference.</div>
</div>
so now i’m like quite confused. i knew networking was important, and in real life the way to get what you want is to know someone who knows someone else… etc… until you reach someone who has control over that thing you want. everything is people-based, even academia (although knowledge is still important), even among those with the most powerful minds. but now i’m not sure to what extent to prioritize obtaining knowledge (particularly in math), and how much energy to direct towards obtaining a bigger picture and forming connections. hopefully i’ll figure it out someday.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-one-five"><i>metamorphosis</i></span><br>
<br>
i absolutely need to transform into a social butterfly. literally overnight, i must go from basically staying at home all day and barely talking to anyone irl, to having an infinite social battery and being willing to talk to anyone, being optimistic and open-minded like i want to be, because i need to create the right sort of first impression in order to make some friends among the 221 other members of my grade during orientation.<br>
i need friends, very badly. my previous friend groups are kinda no longer, or at least i’m not really part of them anymore, and right now i’m kinda just floating in the ocean, watching everyone else, hoping the current will take me somewhere.<br>
<br>
it’s possible, i’ve been very social before <span class="bbfont-three-q">(in certain situations)</span>. i think i can do it…</div>

			<div class="message">i used to wish that there were fewer days until college, but now i half-wish that there were more, because i have <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">way too much to do</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">athemath fall ‘24 logistics<br>
learning some college math (i really should be)<br>
reading a book i promised my english teacher i’d read over the summer<br>
writing cmm problems<br>
<br>
each of which could basically take all day...</div>, and way too little time…<br>
<br>
i’ve been ignoring my friends, letting my oly abilities rust, not even really checking aops blogroll anymore let alone any other (non-discord) social media, because there is just simply no time. even if i try to be as productive as possible, somehow everything takes longer than expected, and i go to sleep with a longer list of things to do the next day. whatever i spend time on, there is a gnawing feeling that i’m neglecting something else (this blog post included). for example, i have spent the last few days basically completely on athemath work (and practicing driving because my driving test is later this week) and part of me feels like i’m just wasting time. other people in my grade are learning lots of stuff and doing research and other cool stuff, and i’m still wrapped up in some high school community service project. many of my peers and even my parents agree with this perception too, wondering when i’ll finally move on. but the other part of me thinks that i’m doing good for the community and this is something that needs to be done, and if i don’t do it then who will? and it <i>is</i> really exciting to see something grow -- almost double in size each year -- and know that you’re providing stepping stones for peoples’ success.<br>
<br>
and if i focus more on something else, like learning higher math, then i’m definitely going to feel like i’m neglecting athemath. even now, i believe that there’s so much more i could be doing that i’m not. there’s still quite a long way to go until every athemath student feels like part of the community; a problem that will take lots of time and energy to solve.<br>
<br>
but i’m going to have to eventually figure my life out. if i work hard enough during these next couple weeks, which will certainly also require spending a lot of time on it, then athemath fall ‘24 can have sufficiently taken off by the time i go to college, that it’ll be able to run smoothly under the controls of other people, and i’ll be able to focus on other things without the constant worry that i’m not doing enough for it. i’ll finally be able to try and catch up to everyone else in my grade.<br>
<br>
i guess the main question is, how much do i care about following the standard path of success, and how much am i willing to venture off in directions that may or may not contribute to my success later on, but that i find interesting? i think i’m generally pretty susceptible to peer pressure and take peoples’ advice on things, but at the same time i don’t always follow through with things i say i’ll do…<br>

			<div class="message">i’m in Rwanda right now helping to teach math coaches from various African countries, (and maybe the Rwandan math olympiad students next week too)!<br>
<br>
the first thing i noticed was how much people smile in this country. i’ve rarely seen smiles that big before, especially not in america. <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link cmty-hide-open" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">people definitely seem overall happier here than in america.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display: block;">but there are some people in america kinda like this too; who do random completely unprompted acts of kindness, like smiling at you or offering something. it’s unclear how much they get out of this other than an internal pang of satisfaction, but maybe that is enough? anyway, i often wonder how such people can have so much kindness in them. i guess a lot of it is mindset; it’s not really about your life situation but rather how you see it. if you constantly believe you’re screwed, you’re going to be stressed and pessimistic, while if you think your life is pretty good then you’re generally going to be happier, and your mood affects your actions and the people around you</div> maybe because they get so much happiness and satisfaction out of the smallest things, and don’t expect as much in general. from my experiences: children jump up and down when you wave to them. when you say thank you to someone, their eyes light up with gratitude and they smile a very big smile. children play on the dirt roads outside our Airbnb, with nature and soccer balls instead of the internet, and you can hear their faint voices and shrieks all day, along with the chirping of crickets. on the big roads, cars and motorbike taxis slide past each other with only inches to spare. music can often be heard between 8am and 11pm, and many homes have their doors (or curtains) open and adults chatting outside on lawn chairs. a large amount of socialization happens outside, as one of the math program directors told me, and so even with the winding roads and mazes of tin roofed houses, it feels very... open.<br>
<br>
it’s a different way of life, but a very wholesome one. some developing countries are clearly <i>developing</i>, like you can tell that they’re on the rise.<br>
<br>
i’ve never taught 20-30 year olds before. the dynamic is kinda weird because i feel like they have so much more life experience than me (they definitely do) yet i’m supposed to be teaching them something. they are all college, masters, or PhD students, so they definitely have so much more higher math knowledge than me. i half-wish that they would teach me some of this so that it doesn’t falsely seem like i’m the more knowledgeable one here, but there’s also the language barrier LOL... i'm still working on understanding their accents oops. many of them didn’t have a chance to participate in math olympiads much or at all, since their countries’ math olympiad programs were founded only a few years ago, yet they’re all very eager to learn olympiad math so that they can teach it to younger students from their countries. in countries like these, doing well at international olympiads really is a ticket to a much better life, aka going to college abroad. anyway, these math-coaches-in-training are all stunningly friendly and eager to learn, and also see me as a peer which is nice<br>
i also met some recent graduates of the Rwandan math olympiad program who went to IMO this year and they were really nice <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> they’re hoping to go to college abroad but want to help coach the younger students while doing a gap year<br>
<br>
this summer has been very interesting; i’ve taught irl 3 disjoint age ranges of ppl: 5th-8th graders, 9th-12th graders, and 20-30 year olds. i’ve definitely improved at in-person teaching, but i still have a long way to go. in-person teaching is fun tbh; it’s kinda crazy to think about how scared i was of it in 7th grade<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">,</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">i TA'd a 5th grade class like every week and i was actually terrified (and also did a really bad job)</div> and i wish i had more opportunities to do it lol<br>
<br>
i’m very honored and lucky to have this opportunity -- basically i’d been teaching for various countries online and someone i know offered to take me and some other ppl here for free to teach; and i was like why not, because what better ways do i have to spend this summer?</div>

			<div class="message">ive noticed some things<br>
contrary to what you’d think of someone “good at math”…
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>i like doing repetitive tasks and things that dont require much brain</li>
<li>i’m really bad at other sciences (like phys, chem, cs)</li>
<li>i’m really bad at understanding stuff quickly, especially if it contains complicated notation -- i often have to hear or read smth many times to understand it. i feel like i’m worse at understanding things in this way than my friends.</li>
<li>i have like no creativity -- its rly hard for me to innovate and like think of <i>new</i> ideas</li>
<li>i’m kinda scared of trying new things in general</li>
<li>i’m really really forgetful, like my sister will teach me how to play a game and then ill forget in 2 weeks. or i’ll learn a term or concept in school and then forget in 1-2 weeks. it’s actually problematic. maybe i don’t spend enough effort actually committing stuff to memory?</li>
</ul>
so in some ways i feel like a bot, trained to do math contests and only that; to efficiently grind but not think much outside the box. i’m not like the normal stereotype of someone good at math. i’m like the ordinariest of ordinary people, who was simply programmed to solve (certain types of) math problems.<br>
<br>
idk, at some point i’m gonna have to stop following other ppl and applying stuff that is already well known and create <i>new</i> things and get good at things that are not math. i’m definitely going to make a conscious effort to do this in the future.<br>
<br>
on a different note, <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link cmty-hide-open" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">this summer is very busy haha</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display: block;">i <i>might</i> be going to rwanda in 2 days (it was initially pakistan but it got changed) to teach math to the olympiad training camp. <i>might</i> because there were lots of complications.<br>
i actually havent rly been free for any of this summer except for early june; there have always been so many things to do<br>
like right now: writing CMM problems, preparing for athemath next year (i spent basically all of today reaching out to donors and stuff :skull:), learning some higher math, doing some oly problems i want to do, reading the books i borrowed from my english teacher cuz i said i’d read them over the summer lol<br>
so there is like way more stuff to do than there is time<br>
i havent even rly been wasting time!! except for on linkedin and x and aops blogroll sometimes i guess. but way less than i used to<br>
its exciting though; life is exciting i guess</div></div>

			<div class="message">when i click on a blog post and see four identical comments, each with just the word “admits”, a little piece of my heart falls out<br>
<br>
and i think back to the days when, immature and young as we were, somehow there was still variety in the things we said in the AoPS FTW chat -- some people spammed <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link cmty-hide-open" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">strange emojis</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display: block;">(^_^)</div>, others random <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">strings of letters</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">aops dopa soa sopa</div>, others <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link cmty-hide-open" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">interesting words</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display: block;">yeet, reeee, etc</div> -- but everyone with some sort of distinctness in the way they typed and acted. there was not the desire to be part of an elite group, the admission ticket being the spamming of a certain obscure phrase that the others wouldn’t understand. we still valued uniqueness.<br>
<br>
it was during covid when i first had the desire to be exactly like someone else -- i think we all changed our discord profiles to match dennis’s, and then to a plain blue discord icon with the username “ivy” to confuse everyone, and then we spammed orz and self deprecated like crazy. back then i kinda had no life, and being part of a group felt good, like i was finally one of the cool kids. only later would i realize how fake that sense of pride was; how i was only doing it because i didn’t have enough self confidence, so i copied the others who were actually “good at math”, as if it would make me one of them. i didn’t really care whether they were kind or generous people; i only cared that they were good at math, and that made me want to be like them in every way. in reality, we probably all thought the same way. we were probably all traveling in circles, thinking that at least there would be someone nearby.<br>
<br>
and then it evolved from cultish behavior to the repetition of jargon, most notably “orz”; partly because everyone else did it, and partly because the self deprecating culture and hypercompetitiveness of the math community made it natural to put people on pedestals based on their math abilities.<br>
and i guess i kinda also did it to feel young? at mop 2022, we were known as the “aops spammers” and rather than recognizing it as a negative testament to our lack of grass-touching, we took pride in it, because we were young enough that we <i>could</i> spend all day on AoPS, in our own world, the competition math bubble. and at mop 2023, although i wasn’t really young anymore, i simply copied what the youngsters were doing so i could pretend to be.<br>
<br>
but at some point, you get too old.<br>
<br>
at some point, you realize that there is something really depressing about a conversation which is just back and forth “orz”. where every word has meaning as proof that you’re part of the inner circle of the math community, but no meaning as part of the message you’re trying to convey to someone else. or is there even such a message? 4-5 distinct words can't communicate much nuance. i guess almost everyone goes through a phase of life in which bandwagoning is cool, but i wish i had known at the time that there was more to peoples’ worth than their math abilities. and at some point, that phase of life has to end.<br>
<br>
i can’t help but think of what would’ve happened if degenerate slang had been this widespread when i first got into AoPS in 5th or 6th grade. i probably would’ve joined the bandwagon even sooner; been brainwashed even more quickly that to be cool i had to replace my normal speech with strange words invented by the math geniuses who everyone worshipped. i probably would not have made as many friends, made as many connections, and spent as many late nights online, had the FTW chat been filled with “xooks”.<br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
18 hours have passed since i returned home from some trips, and i’m again searching… for meaning. for something to be enthralled by, addicted to. something that i’ll spend all day on and never have hope of finishing. i need to be inspired again, so that i forget what i am physically and stare into exactly one spot, so that the beats of electronic music synchronize with the turning of gears in my head. there are many options, and i’ll eventually find something. 46 days is too much…</div>

			<div class="message">everything about math comps is still so fresh in my mind, rekindled when i take a timed test again, like the G2 team contest; it all feels so real again, and every part of it -- the stress, the delight of getting something right, the feeling that i’m dragging my team down -- is just how it used to be. sparks that i thought would sink underground with time are still only barely beneath the surface, unearthed so easily by this two-week time capsule, only to be promptly re-buried.<br>
<br>
although i haven’t done geo for a while, or been surrounded by people grinding olympiad math, one day of this camp makes everything click and i’m a high schooler again whose whole life is olympiad math. i’m in the Simmons dining hall, testsolving Problem Set problems and searching through my brain and AoPS for as many cool problems to put in handouts as i can, surrounded by heads dutifully bowed over sheets of paper and with math community degen phrases ringing out every now and then. in order to teach my classes well, i must practice some geo, aka spend whatever free time i have on it -- something i haven’t done for a while. it’s like i shut a drawer a few months ago and now it’s being forcibly, but more like lovingly, opened.<br>
<br>
but when i’m amongst these crowds of girls 1,2,3,4 years younger than me, i honestly feel at home. more at home than in my real home, more at home than with any group of college students<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">,</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">well it’s worth noting that i haven’t really socialized with many college students other than like random ppl ive met at cpw and discotech…</div>, maybe more at home than with moppers even. chatting at 11pm and making friendship bracelets to take ourselves back to elementary/middle school, i’m surprised that there actually exist people who share so many of my viewpoints, and who are so willing to listen. i honestly don’t feel mentally older than them at all; if age correlates with life experience then i think many of them have about the same amount as i do; and we probably only have different mindsets at these different stages of life due to society pushing us in different directions.<br>
<br>
G2 has given me a big enough dose of belonging to last quite a while, so that hopefully i can muster up the courage to be the odd one out again, just in case i’ll need to do so, and stop myself from falling into the orbits that are too commonly followed. for now, the drawer will close until next time.<br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">something interesting another staff member said</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">was that their life was more stressful in high school than after that, which i was quite surprised by because i thought adults had way more matters to take care of, and also because i know this is definitely not true for my parents. the reasons are believable -- many high schoolers feel a lot of pressure to get into college, and are also itching to be free and make their own life decisions -- but i can’t help but wonder, is this how it should be? children having underdeveloped brains surely have less intellectual potential than adults, and for a span of four years at the end of childhood, when you know little about the actual world, to be the time of highest exertion seems a bit suboptimal.</div><br>
<br>
this was one of the first trips in which i didn’t think about whether or not to tell my parents about a math competition result on the way home; in which i didn’t worry about the world being disappointed in me or surprised by my performance; in which a competition wasn’t the main part of the news. it feels a little bit empty, like a climax and some of my effort are missing -- but i guess if i think about it in a certain way, very full.</div>

			<div class="message">uhh dont ask why im awake this late… i was waiting for my hair to dry and got carried away on discord and i dont rly have to wake up early tomorrow because there’s nothing other than a mock olympiad which im not even taking; im proctoring… but my brain is not working well enough to do math and is working barely enough to yap so here we are<br>
<br>
sometimes when i’m really stressed i wish i could fast forward time to when im not very stressed and life is good<br>
and now is one of those life is good moments; im rly not overwhelmingly stressed about anything <span class="bbfont-three-q">... i do have a few things i need to do but theyre generally pretty fun</span><br>
and i kinda feel like im not appreciating it enough<br>
like sometime in the near future im gonna be like overwhelmed by college or having low self confidence or smth or doubting my life and im gonna wish that it was july 2024 again<br>
so anyway yeah its weird we’re always wishing for more even if we’re in a relatively good position<br>
<br>
i was thinking about this because i always got stressed about mock olympiads and just contests in general<br>
id wish for them to be over and for me to not have to experience the pain of feeling like i was expected to solve something but wouldnt be able to and would disappoint everyone including myself<br>
almost every olympiad was painful in this way<br>
i enjoyed the problems, and challenging myself, but it was mostly the social pressure that made them painful<br>
so every time before a contest id wish that somehow i could just skip those next 5 hours and be done… or even skip those next few years and be done [with contests] for real…<br>
<br>
and now that has happened, and i dont rly feel anything. i should probably feel joy, like im finally where i wanted to be, i can finally do math and enjoy it in peace without the pressure of my peers and their parents and the whole math community, im finally free… <span class="bbfont-three-q">well so i think; what’s to come might as well be much harder than oly...</span><br>
<br>
i do honestly feel so free tho. idk if ive ever felt this free before. because there are so, so many possibilities which have yet to be narrowed down and now im just in limbo, floating, with yet to be sucked into one vacuum or another<br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
another random thing i was thinking about is, an overwhelming majority of my friends are my age or younger. like, i have barely any friends older than me. this might be a high school senior thing but its rly rly extreme in my case-- i often talk with ppl 1-3 years younger than me and i kinda see them on the same level as me but anyone 1-3 years older than me i suddenly imagine as having so much more life experience, and somehow the dynamic just feels different, more of mentor-student and less of friends. (well also ive barely talked irl with anyone 1-3 years older than me in the past year.) i do find a lot of younger ppl a lot of fun to talk to tho lol<br>
<br>
even my own grade i dont interact with much. i feel like i have about the same number of friends in my grade as in the grade below, and maybe even 2 grades below. <strike>theyre all kinda just in the same grade in my pov at this point</strike>… but i know this is really not the case lol<br>
<br>
i think this is caused by a combination of being the oldest kid in my family, interacting with a lot of younger kids in math communities through teaching and stuff, and being rly short so ppl often mistake me for being younger<br>
<br>
i think its getting a little better tho, and hopefully will in college-- ive made a few friends from my college so far <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> so hopefully i will eventually have a more balanced age distribution of ppl i interact with lol</div>

<br>
i need to de-rust at geo (and other oly subjects) lmao cuz im teaching some classes in the next few days and havent rly done geo in the past few weeks so im gonna be grinding a bit <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> fortunately i basically get the mornings (and early afternoons) to myself since i dont have to attend other ppls' classes <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> so thats very convenient<br>
<br>
overall a lot less work than math in the mountains, cuz kids are a lot older and more independent (and also quite good at following directions lol)<br>
i also feel like im able to interact with and relate with the students a lot more since im not too much older than them and have gone through a lot of the things they did, which is really nice <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
all the kids are rly rly nice and studious (typical of g2) <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
we're staying in simmons which is honestly a great dorm. probably my favorite mit dorm. although it has rly weird/controversial architecture, i just happen to like a lot of random things about it, like the many windows that you can open and let in breeze, the <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">plentiful singles</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">i generally dont spend that much time in my room, and am the type of person to be decent friends with a lot of ppl rather than besties with like one or two ppl, so i find singles appealing, though i dont have a rly strong preference</div>, the metal sinks and shiny black floors because they just give off a certain vibe, the design that's a combination of geometric and cave-like, and especially the little lounges in the corners of floors with winding staircases between consecutive floors. even though there's no air conditioning, i don't feel like it's too hot because you can open the windows (there are sooo many windows). i guess im not that picky about heat though. the one possibly sub-optimal thing about simmons is that it's pretty hard to navigate because there are huge holes in the building (by design) so some floors dont go all the way across, but there are elevators and im sure one could travel from one place to another via stairs with enough time. the nontrivial-ness of it makes it more interesting.<br>
so anyway, hot take but simmons is a pretty cool dorm, architecture-wise <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> i dont know anything about the actual MIT culture here tho LMAO</div>

			<div class="message">my 13 days of placement exam grinding finally ended!! <strike>so i can stop being dead</strike><br>
im actually pretty confident about a few of them which im kinda surprised about because ngl i didnt have very high hopes about trying to learn a bunch of classes which i didnt really know <i>and given how bad my memory is</i> so it was really just a shot in the dark but oh well... it was worth the effort : D and there's something strangely fun about grinding; it makes u forget the mundanities of the real world<br>
for this reason i <i>really</i> need to keep myself busy with stuff<br>
it was interesting to experience the suspense and stress like that of contests again; the feeling that you're gonna be screwed if u don't lock in and actually focus<br>
i think the placement exams might've made me a little less scared of college math though. it was like borderline college math, but a lot of it was new to me, yet it actually made sense (sometimes after staring at for like half an hour) and many of the resources i used were written in ways very easy to parse<br>
<br>
now onto a new chapter-- G2!! im leaving very early tomorrow morning so i should probably sleep soon : D<br>
second time being a staff member at a camp-- i wonder how this will compare to mitm<br>
it will probably be very different but with maybe a few parallels<br>
<br>
hmm what else is going on in my life... not much given that i basically spent all my free time grinding for the past 2 weeks<br>
i did kinda get into (certain) pop music again because that was the only way i could have the motivation to grind<br>
<br>
time to catch up on everything i haven't been doing, like geo (omg im probably so rusty) and actually writing my G2 handouts !! and maybe athemath advertising and CMM problem writing......</div>

			<div class="message">at the very end of math in the mountains, a lot of parents said it changed their lives or their childrens’, but i think it changed mine too<br>
<br>
it was very different from all the other math communities i’ve seen before-- not degenerate, not competitive, and actually <i>happy</i>-- not a single person there looked like they were being forced by their parents to do something they disliked. i guess you could say it was <i>very wholesome</i>.<br>
<br>
i guess the campers were young enough that (the majority of them) hadn’t really experienced the pains of competitive math yet-- the gnawing feeling that you aren’t as good as your peers, the constant comparing and being compared to them, the realization that you aren’t going to reach your goals because there’s not enough time left<br>
so they just truly enjoyed it<br>
<br>
rather than even focusing on competitions, or getting something for a resume or college app, they explored what they thought was cool-- working on number grid puzzles whenever they could, drawing almost-pascal’s-triangles and searching for patterns, bashing out terms of sequences and seeing if they could engineer’s-induct a recurrence--<br>
<br>
and with that pure joy came a collaborativeness i hadn’t really seen before in the math community. when no one has AIME qualed yet, there’s no divide like between mop color groups, or returning moppers and new ones, or 5 time AIME quals and 1 time AIME quals-- so people mingle much more, there are absolutely 0 cliques, and math skill isn’t a factor when you choose who to play, or even do math, with<br>
there were also no electronics because these kids didn’t have their own phones yet<br>
<br>
nor was there the sentiment of <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">“if you get too excited about math then you’re a nerd and are not cool”</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">tangentially related but:<br>
<br>
something a parent said on a hike really stood out to me: “something happens to math nerds when they hit puberty-- some realize that if they do certain things to their appearance and/or character then they can get a bf/gf [or basically get rizz], and so they choose this seemingly easier path over grinding math”<br>
<br>
and she also pointed out that this happens more frequently with girls than boys, and that girls hit puberty first, and that this may explain the gender imbalance in math kids, which is actually a very interesting and quite valid viewpoint that i hadn’t heard before<br>
<br>
she was clearly worried that this would happen to her 12 year old daughter, who is brilliant at math but also a billion other things like fencing, swimming, i forgot the rest, and also is not the nerdiest kid, like she can fit in with a “normal” crowd and is sometimes swayed by “popular” trends<br>
<br>
it’s a really difficult choice actually</div> that too many people absorb in late middle school<br>
nor the awkwardness of interacting with other genders, or at least not in the same way<br>
nor the distancing from parents that often happens around that age; the feeling that you know what’s best for yourself and no longer need their outdated advice-- children actually hugged parents, and i was like <i>wow</i><br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
but i think another big reason for its impact on me was the other counselors-- they were all such amazing people<br>
<br>
for a bit of background info, they will all be in college next year and majoring in math (with possibly something else too)<br>
about half of them were from the bay area but they weren’t hypercompetitive like the bay area is notorious for<br>
they all had a true interest in (not only competition) math characteristic of few high schoolers, infinite energy, the warmest of intentions, and skills to work with children that i wish i had<br>
they could pass off as normal high schoolers / college students on the street, yet were so special inside<br>
and they really, really cared about the children; they spent from sunup to sundown with them, trying to be as good role models and helping hands as possible.<br>
(this really rubbed off on me, too)<br>
some examples of memorable/admirable things done by other counselors (which i witnessed) were:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>pulling a splinter out of a boy’s finger and being really comforting and encouraging because the boy was really scared</li>
<li>helping a boy discover a pattern related to catalan numbers during a meal</li>
<li>earnestly teaching special relativity to a group of antsy, sleepy, mosquito-bitten kids at 8pm, even though half the time was spent getting their attention, and having them leave very glad they chose to come</li>
<li>frequently chatting with a girl and her family who had covid and had to sit outside so they didn’t get to interact much with everyone else</li>
<li>teaching math to a 7 year old during car rides with anything available, sometimes even a deck of cards</li>
<li>somehow magically calming down kids who were in heated moods</li>
<li>TA’ing classes that they had no idea of the material for because so much of it was done on the fly (the night before) and figuring out the punchlines before the kids so that they could be of help</li>
<li>giving kids who were behind easier problems that would help them, and kids who were ahead challenge problems, to prevent boredom during class</li>
<li>purple guy (code name) literally having infinite physical energy, like i actually dont get it</li>
<li>but most of all, showing campers that you didn’t have to be boring, or depressed, or really nerdy to be excited about math. you can just be genuinely excited, as a trip in a time machine might remind us of</li>
</ul>
<br>
anyway, before, i thought i was familiar with most of math community, but math in the mountains made me realize that i only knew a small portion. the world is so big and although connected, there are always new niches to discover. when you think you know something, you really don’t.<br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
kinda unrelated, but something ive been thinking about:<br>

<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">myself wrote:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">when in college, should i completely focus on it, immerse myself in a box that’s several blocks wide on end and filled with amazing students and professors who could propel me forward and who i could propel forward? 24 is a lot of hours in a day, but there would be so many things to do that all that time could very easily disappear…<br>
<br>
or should i peek my head out so that the corner of my eye is facing the rest of the world, keep in mind that the world is not just a heaven of infinite knowledge to explore but rather contains many unfortunate truths, and make efforts to contribute to the lives of people all over the world? (well of course i’m going to spend at least a bit of time in athemath, and DM’ing my closest friends outside of college, but to what extent?)</div>
</div>
<br>
well the answer is obviously the second one, because trapping oneself in a small bubble is rarely a good thing, no matter what type it is. the point of learning a lot is to put the knowledge to practical good anyway, which requires knowing about and having empathy for many different various situations<br>
<br>
but to what extent?<br>
it’s a hard balance and i’m not exactly sure yet<br>
24 is not enough hours in a day. there are too many things to do, too much to explore and discover, and the world is just so big <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">i think im long overdue for a post<br>
<br>
anyway im a counselor for <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">math in the mountains</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">which has been going on since the 22nd (but i arrived on the 20th to do some pre-camp prep work with the other staff members)</div><br>
it is VERY fun<br>
<br>
(im typing this at midnight because that's the only time i really have to be on my computer all day and i'm somehow not very tired) (but i will probably be really tired tomorrow morning and have to drink caffeine and almost fall asleep in classes and/or assemblies which is really bad because i'm a counselor)<br>
<br>
so yeah this will probably not be very well articulated<br>
<br>
anyway it's VERY fun because the people are so cool <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> the campers are like aged 10-13 (but mostly on the younger side i think, and there are a lot of younger siblings) and they're so pure, innocent, extraverted, positive, math-loving, ......, just so many great qualities that i forgot existed in humans<br>
<br>
(the instructors are also really cool renowned mathematicians and the other counselors are REALLY cool people who are my age or a few years older, and come from very different backgrounds from me but all love math <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley">)<br>
<br>
basically as counselors we help to TA the classes <strike>but so far ive basically ended up either sitting in a corner and smiling and only very occasionally adding stuff, or working with the kids in groups almost as if im one of them</strike> and interact with the students a lot too, running small events to teach them stuff and making sure they have fun and organizing stuff<br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
some thoughts on being a counselor for a camp for small children (ive never been a staff member for any summer camp before):<br>

<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>camps are SO MUCH MORE tiring for the staff members than for the campers, especially if the campers are young</li>
<li>to be a counselor for this camp, you kinda have to be able to shout and get kids' attention cuz like u have to get a lot of them to go somewhere as a group and sometimes they don't listen, and i'm really bad at shouting <strike>so sometimes i get a kid to shout for me</strike></li>
<li>i think because of my appearance and the way i act (i'm pretty much always nice to the campers and i laugh a lot and try to be very social) the campers view me as less of an authority figure than the other staff members, which makes it harder to get them to listen to me, but also it's easier to socialize with them on the same level</li>
<li>so yeah i'm really bad at being firm, and for this reason (and because i'm not really the best at entertaining kids lol) sometimes i feel like i'm worse than the other counselors, am doing a bad job, etc... but no one seems to be mad at me yet and i have made quite a lot of friends sooooo</li>
<li>interacting with people for like 15 hours a day was really draining at first but now that it's been a few days i'm getting the hang of things, and it's not so bad anymore-- also the kids have a LOT of energy which is honestly really contagious so i have a lot more energy than i usually do <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"></li>
</ul>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
some especially cool moments:<br>

<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>a talk by Ken Ono about a math theorem he recently discovered AND about his life, his dad's life, and ramanujan's life (which was very cool and inspiring :0)</li>
<li>playing games with the campers including BS, set, boop, and this game where i give them a math problem and they race to solve it-- the first two got very chaotic lmao because ppl were trolling but it was fun</li>
<li>teaching lots of campers how to make origami stellated cuboctahedrons and then being taught how to make sonobe units and bonding over love of polyhedra</li>
<li>learning about SET hyperplanes and mapping out finite projective planes with Spot It cards</li>
<li>watching Paul Zeitz teach about the geometry of complex numbers-- he is actually such an amazing teacher<br>
<br>
also random but literally none of this involved technology; it's amazing how much fun one can still have without technology even today</li>
</ul>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
oh yeah i also turned 18 recently <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> kinda sad because a very exciting chapter of my life has now officially ended<br>
i did receive the letter from myself 2.5 years ago, and it's kinda interesting because it contains a lot of "i really hope you still do X" and i do still do X. i guess i've changed less than i imagined. but some things are quite different though, like my long-term goals and what i thought was the definition of success?<br>

<hr class="bbcode_rule">
<br>
somehow, i think being at math in the mountains has made more optimistic about the future. i'm not exactly sure why, since working with young children is like the opposite of what i'm going to do in the future-- go to college and interact with other college students and professors-- but i think it's because this is something i never would've imagined myself doing. it's so, so different from MOP or the olympiad math community or OTIS or G2 or really anything i've experienced in high school, yet it's so amazing. and i guess this is an example of how there are so many wonderful things in the world left to explore, no matter how many good memories of the past you have so far.</div>

			<div class="message">brief life update cuz not much happening in my life nowadays (school ended) and i dont rly feel like writing anything actually substantial atm :flushed:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>bruh why am i still so addicted to oly, its actually sooooo hard to stop. i still do geo whenever i feel like it (which is like all the time) and combo is fun too sometimes. i really need to start learning college math ! ! ! but also i feel like i'll be a better TA for G2/math in the mountains, (and a better teacher if i am actually going to other countries this summer), if im still really into oly so ahhhh such a hard decision ;-; some people say 'just have fun' during the summer after senior year, which is what i'm doing, but others say its a time to build new skills...</li>
<li>i will have to actually start being productive soon because i gotta do my english placement test (which is basically an ap lang essay) in the next few days and actually study for math / maybe cs placement tests (which dont rly matter but still i rly need to not fail)</li>
<li>i also need to stop slacking on athemath and like actually prepare for next season, somehow not go bankrupt, and do a better job managing ppl and keeping track of money etc</li>
<li>i <i>have</i> been spending a lot of time with my sister <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> who's 10 yrs old so like she really needs irl interaction or else she's gonna get really bored over the summer, and my parents are kinda too busy to spend time with her... i've been doing some amc problems with her and playing board games and going for bike rides. honestly it does make me a less lonely too, otherwise literally all of my interaction every day would be from discord, which does get a bit lonely sometimes especially during the summer when ppl are busy... i really don't know how only children do it lol... when i was young i always had my siblings to play with <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"></li>
<li>i have to take my driving test in a week and like there's no way i'm gonna pass, i'm soooo bad at driving T_T i barely know how to parallel park but only with my mom literally telling me what to do at the right times so this is actually badddd and i dont know like half the signals im supposed to demonstrate for the test. my mom says she'll take me parallel parking this weekend, which is like very much needed :pray: i cant believe im procrastinating as badly on this as all of my school tests ! ! also wth apparently i need to bring a lot of forms to the test?? what?? reading stuff online is hard and different websites say different things :/<br>
Edit: actually the driving test has been postponed to july since my mom is too busy to teach me to parallel park <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"></li>
<li>i'm going to Math in the Mountains (a summer camp in wyoming) in a week! i honestly have no idea what to expect lol im gonna be a counselor but ive gotten like very little information about what i'm actually gonna be doing :flushed: anyway hopefully it will be fun!!</li>
<li>i'm gonna be 18 in 10 days ;-; rlyyyyy not looking forward to it. i haven't looked forward to a birthday since i was like 10 or smth, getting older always just sounds so depressing. there's nothing new i'll be able to do that i'm excited for. i am looking forward to one thing though, receiving a letter by my january 2022 self, sent through the internet. i'm actually very interested to see how my brain worked in january 2022 because i've changed soooooo much; that feels like half a lifetime ago.</li>
<li>its kinda interesting, and maybe a tiny bit sad, how my grade (in school) is just nonexistent now. all throughout the year it was like "seniors this" and "seniors that" and now there are just... no seniors. having been pretty distant from my classmates (only talking to them at school etc), it really feels like everyone and everything has just evaporated, and now all that's left of them are just memories. there was this whatsapp group which was basically exploding with messages during the last few weeks of school, cuz so much happened then, and now it's just completely silent.</li>

			<div class="message"><i>how much i loved math comps</i><br>
<br>
arml: one of my favorite math competitions since 5th grade, because of staying overnight with my team and being able to meet so many people from all over the east coast. years of memories linger around the university-- the grass outside the creamery where i used to play hide-and-seek with my teammates in middle school before they quit math or became more into obtaining rizz than childish activities, the windowsill in Thomas Hall where i played Flash FTW, the area outside bryce jordan center where i’d always find my friends in the bottleneck-stopped crowd, the huge ring-shaped corridor that i’d circle round and round, like it would never end…
<hr class="bbcode_rule">
i’ve barely done any computational math in the past year, but somehow i feel more confident than last year. i think it’s from watching other Athemath TA’s live-solve math problems and talk through their thought processes. i’m gonna channel my inner Neal and Raina. and surely, after letting stress take over my mind so many times, causing me to stall for the last few minutes instead of finishing a problem, i should have learned my lesson by now. however, i’m afraid to embrace too much confidence or else it’ll backfire, like at MP4G.<br>
<br>
a few minutes into the team round, i still haven’t solved problem 7 and start to worry that i’m letting the team down; like i did on CMIMC TCS round both this year and last, and so many other contests; that i’ll fall short of their idea of mopper skill level and disappoint them. i can’t let them know how i’m struggling; how i’m actually one of the weakest moppers. i just gotta keep cool and keep going.<br>
almost to the end of the power round, i’m working on problem 10 and feel close but just can’t finish it. flashbacks to 2024 usamo 2/5, 2023 tstst p5, and 2022 tstst p2/6 remind me of knowing i wasn’t going to solve the problem but not giving up until the very end, hanging on to that thread of hope for a miracle to occur.<br>
<br>
halfway through the individual round, i’m so nervous because i haven’t gotten any wrong so far but will probably end up butchering my chance just like i have at every other arml. the adrenaline is making my teeth chatter, handwriting messier than usual, and giving me the strong urge to squeeze something.<br>
i’m mentally forcing myself to do well, just like before the bmt 2022 geo round in that dim, packed classroom, or the tstst in cool industrious HoA.<br>
<br>
the announcer finishes reading problems 9 and 10, and i go right to problem 10, because for the first time in forever, it’s a p10 geo, looks cool, and it would be extremely embarrassing as a geo main if i didn’t at least try it. i immediately think of monge (definitely not due to Neal being obsessed with the theorem) but then i realize i don’t have enough info to solve the problem, and stall for a minute-- dreading that this might become like usamo p5-- until i realize that the circles’ centers are collinear with their exsimilicenter, and use menelaus and pythag to finish. i screw up the computation a few times, but fortunately end up with the right answer.<br>
<br>
there is no way this is actually happening. it has got to be a gift from up high, like my other miracle geo solves. after the individual round, i have enough energy to fill a room, so i start shouting to my teammates and being really high for the rest of the day.<br>
<br>
during lunch i wander around the oval-shaped corridor of bryce jordan center, searching for familiar faces and saying quick hellos. but this time i’m no longer searching for other members of LIVE with Michelle and Vincent-- or trying to film embarrassing interviews with Neal, Tiger, and Feodor-- or singing parodies of A Million Dreams with Vincent, Ritwin, Jenny, or Dotted-- or taking pics with the red panda with Ritwin and Rachel-- or video calling my sister with Vincent-- or trying to find the hidden bmt answer keys with Neal. i no longer recognize a huge amount of the people, because a lot of them are much younger than me and so i don’t know them very well. but it is very nice to see those who i do recognize again, and the fact that i even recognize any at all makes me feel, for once, like i am actually <i>there</i>.
<hr class="bbcode_rule">
i think my favorite part of math comps is the ability to let loose and be my true self, aka the people. at school and everywhere else, i put on a veneer of extreme rule-abiding-ness, diligence, respectfulness, etc; only when i interact with math friends am i really able to be goofy, make jokes that people might actually get, and break rules for fun-- such as mop campus boundaries and no paper airplanes at arml-- which is honestly so much more fun than following rules all the time. i think this is because the math community has a really pure and logical sense of humor. sure it’s kinda degenerate, but it’s so much better than the average teenager’s. communities where being funny requires brain, as opposed to lack of brain, are priceless.<br>
<br>
math contests aren’t easy. they’re so, so stressful, and push us to our limits. they’re filled with surprises and sudden shocks that will get you if you aren’t prepared. but somehow, when pushed to our limits, we’re also more likely to depend on and support each other. after spending a whole day-- or many-- working together on problems under a time limit, we really understand each others’ strengths and weaknesses, have seen each other in our most panicked states, and have relied on each other to keep <strike>ourselves</strike> the team’s score alive. friendships formed at math competitions, or i guess any sort of high-stakes event, are just on a different level-- like being forged in fire-- the extreme being how fantasy novels’ protagonist trios are the best of friends. when you’ve been through so much together, you just… can’t leave.<br>
<br>
we exit bryce jordan center, the same way as every year in the past, but one thing is different-- i’m probably never coming back. i’ll probably never experience all of these things again. it’s surreal, like riding away from bmt 2022 in the Foxes’ car, realizing that something had changed within me.<br>

			<div class="message">i really dont feel like im actually going to leave [home] soon<br>
part of me (actually a large part) is excited about the future and wants to leave asap and be free, but the other part just doesn't want to leave home<br>
<br>
not because im unsure of whether ill be okay, but because im unsure of whether my family will be okay<br>
i mean yes they will but...<br>
its going to be different<br>
and ive always been kinda afraid of change; a creature of habit<br>
maybe its also that im the oldest child so i always feel like im exploring something new and scary even though its perfectly normal<br>
<br>
a small part of me worries that i'll lose the role i play in this family, which is one of the most valuable communities i'm in. that my siblings will trust me less, my parents will view me as a different person from before, and overall i'll be seen more as a guest than a member.<br>
<br>
but mostly, i think im concerned for my sister, who is 7.5 years younger than me. ive been there for all of her life (well obviously) and for the first few years i was almost as much a caretaker as our mom was. i'd carry her places and read her books and entertain her, and this was a large source of my own happiness back then too. i think i would've been significantly less happy at ages 9-13 without her. i still remember when i'd write math problems for her; show her drawings on my math papers that i didn't show anyone else; spoil her even though our mom didn't like it. i'd usually take her side in arguments with our brother... oops... <i>but my brother is much better at arguing than her so this makes it more fair right??</i><br>
<br>
we don't interact as much anymore, but i'd like to think that i'm still kinda an important part of her life. we still show each other our drawings, plan gifts for people, and other things our brother wouldn't understand. i still defend her whenever our brother is being kinda mean. id like to think that im nicer (and dumber) than our brother, and less busy and mature than our mom, and that that somehow makes me an integral part of this so-called family.<br>
<br>
i think i just want my sister to have a normal family, or at least the semblance of one. maybe i'm trying to fill in the gap that our dad left behind. he has been less and less a part of the family as time goes on, and now basically spends no time with us. to me it's like a little crack that has gotten gradually bigger over time, because i remember when was at home more than 10% of the time; had meals with us; sometimes even went on walks with us; and actually talked to us. (i don't think my sister remembers this because she was too young.) but i know that he can't come home more often because he has too much work to do, and big things to accomplish. however, he was still there during my formative years, or at least there enough to have made a big impact on me, and i don't think this is true for my sister.<br>
<br>
so from my point of view, there's a little crack-- or maybe now a decently sized one-- and i really hope that if i leave, the whole thing won't crumble. i'll be okay because i'll no longer be there, so i won't experience the ruin. and my brother and mom probably wouldn't be impacted much because they understand that leaving is a part of life, but not my sister. i don't think she has actually realized i'm going to leave soon. we basically don't talk about it at home because she will get too sad.<br>
<br>
these are her formative years-- the ones in which having a supportive family matters the most-- and i don't want to let her down by just leaving, creating as loud a blank space as my dad has but all at once instead of gradually. i don't want it to cause the sudden realization that this is really not a normal family, but stitched and molded to appear like one<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">actually i've realized that i'm comparing with like the ideal family, or maybe the type most of you have, but there are many families in the world which are much worse off, and i should be thankful that at least we love each other</div><br>
<br>
but i can't, i have to leave.<br>
<br>

			<div class="message">i am pretty excited for summer <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> altho it will be much different from previous summers!<br>
<br>
(i still have 2 weeks of school left but im basically done with all big projects/tests/assignments)<br>
<br>
im especially excited to TA at G2 and <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Math in the Mountains</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">a camp for smol children</div> and maybe (hopefully) help out with the Rwandan and/or Ghanian training camps in those respective countries! they will be very interesting experiences, probably much different from anything i've done before!<br>
<br>
im also gonna try to read napkin and/or some other college math textbooks in my free time. there's something about reading napkin and listening to edm (xomu lanterns &lt;3) that brings me back to summer 2020 when i used to read egmo all day, and its so nostalgic. napkin feels like a foreign language, just like egmo did at the beginning, and i literally had no clue how to attempt even the easiest problems at first, but it was so intriguing how much there was to explore. evan is such a good writer &lt;333. ahhhh those were such good timesss<br>
<br>
and if im feeling extra-creative, i might try to write some problems for a certain college contest. ill try as hard as i can but somehow i just lack the sort of natural creativity ppl like evan, tiger, neal have... T_T<br>
<br>
and what else... im also going to try to interact with my family cuz after i go to college ill probably be interacting with them much less <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> so im gonna like go to the library with my sister and maybe go swimming/biking with her and maybe also some very short road trips (also bc i need to practice driving and get my license at some point before college!) and ill try to play games and stuff with my sister too, since little kids can get bored at home sometimes yk. its kinda sad that ill be away for much of the summer but ill try to make the most out of the times that i am home in terms of acting like part of my family...<br>
<br>
also random but my instagram account got suspended (and basically deleted) a few days ago because i was apparently "not following community guidelines on spam" aka spamming too much... what?!? i didnt think i was spamming at all?!? anywayyy ive been significantly more productive without that timesink so maybe this was meant to be? anyway ill wait a bit to make a new account lol</div>

<br>
interacting with humans is so complicated. it would be so much easier (but still hard) if life was just about learning stuff and having a career. but it's not, there are so many other social expectations.</div><br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">average rly short person thoughts</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">ive never known what it was like to be normal height. ive always been the shortest one, or one of the shortest. now that I think about it, all my life ive kinda been looked down on for this. or maybe it's just my interpretation of it-- ive kinda always felt worse than everyone else because I was shorter than them. esp in elem and middle school, ppl are constantly comparing heights and the taller people are always "better". more attractive, stronger, favored by society. so this kinda got drilled into my head, and I kinda always felt like there was something wrong with me. and I guess that contributed to my outcast-ness; there was no way I was ever going to be in the center stage. ive accepted that i'm always going to be one of the supporting characters on the side-- kinda quirky and not exactly normal-- and I guess this is fine.</div><br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">what should I do for mother's day</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I have to do something. why? because my mom literally raised my 2 siblings and I singlehandedly, since my dad works and travels all day and doesn't help out at all. it's kinda a single parent household most of the time. and now that we're older, she's balancing work and running the household, arguably even busier than before. I actually have no idea how she does it.<br>
<br>
honestly, in this context making a gift is very much about the effort and very little about the actual gift. it's basically to show her that we care.<br>
<br>
so ever since I was very young my siblings and I made sure to do something for every mother's day. (I was usually the one in charge of deciding what to do tho). unfortunately this weekend my sister is out of town (on a trip with my dad...) so I wont have her help in deciding what to do<br>
<br>
buying something is out of the question because 1) we're kinda broke and 2) no idea what to buy since my mom doesn't really use material things much. we've already made many mini origami bouquets in past years soooo not ideal to do it again but that's like a last resort<br>
<br>
maybe i'll just use some very miniature origami I made in middle school and put away in a box for a long while, and put it on a card or smth. if I hadn't procrastinated on this so badly then I could like draw a picture of my mom... maybe i'll do that for her birthday lol</div><br>
oops this post was kinda negative.. I tend to write posts when I’m kinda moody.. but I’ll try to write more positive posts in the future LOL</div>

<li>adversity strengthens friendships. so does time, but adversity can be like a catalyst. all the protagonist trios/duos/quartets/etc in action fantasy novels are such good friends and can basically depend on each other for everything, partly because they've been through so much together, and forced to work together on really difficult and important tasks. mop kinda has this effect, because it's certainly not easy mental health-wise to take tests every other day (mental breakdowns are actually quite common at mop). so i feel like my mop friendships are just on another level from my others. other things like college and other competitions/programs probably also have this effect on friendships.</li>
<li>there are many different types of smart. my brother is an actual genius, but not in the win-every-competition way. he has never really grinded for competitions, (except for a few coding ones), because he would rather just learn and do things he loves. he has no desire to beat other people or collect achievements that will look good on a college application, which is actually really respectable. since he was very young, he spent basically all of his free time reading science books and online articles, and now understands so, so much about the world-- literally more than anyone else I know. if you ask him a random question, like how solar panels work or why butterflies have 4 wings, or how a computer screen works, he would be able to answer.<br>
ngl, being a walking encyclopedia is practically MUCH more useful than being able to solve imo problems. (my brother is also pretty cracked at math and cs). knowledge of science and how the world works can help you solve so many random problems you come across in life, not just the few that show up on an exam in high school.<br>
it's really sad that colleges and stuff might not be able to detect this type of smarts, because they mainly only look at test scores. it's really sad that people who do a bunch of things halfheartedly so that they look multitalented on paper are favored over people who do things just for fun, and genuinely put their whole heart into them.</li>
<li>sometimes i wonder if i'm completely screwing up and all the big decisions ive made in the past year or two have been wrong. i bet many people think i'm stupid for making certain decisions. i occasionally have pessimistic introspective spasms like this <strike>also i feel like listening to taylor swift makes me slightly more sad and introspective but it's still so good</strike></li>
<li>maybe i would be happier if i loved myself more. but that's not going to happen until i fix some of my skissues...</li>
<li>since like 6th grade ive always kinda had like an online community to spam in-- ftw, aops fora, mast, cncm, reaper servers, otis, mop servers-- but soon this might be no longer so?? im kinda too old to spam in otis, and like all servers meant for events in the past, the mop servers will eventually go stagnant... it's just a rite of passage but painfully emphasizes how temporary things are</li>
<li>only one month left until i (and the other seniors) will be free. free to choose our own directions. free to miss the opportunities subtly slipping by. free to roam the world (if we can obtain the resources). free to rot in our dorm rooms. free to look after ourselves. free to not take care of ourselves. free to fly without a safety net. free to crash, and fall, and burn. the pattern of bearings ends and all that's left is cryptic directions to find our own...</li>

			<div class="message">where im not defined by my math abilities<br>
where people don't know me as a mopper, or an X competition qualifier-- they don't have to know<br>
im just someone who likes math<br>
and they're just someone who likes chem, or phys, or astro, or something else that's probably not math, and has spent their life exploring and learning, just like I have<br>
we click so much better because there are no hierarchical levels anymore<br>
no matter if you're an expert on a subject and I barely know anything about it; I'll still talk to you and we can be friends<br>
we aren't defined by the medals on our walls anymore<br>
life isn't about competitions anymore<br>
and it's so freeing<br>
<br>
I don't think math is <i>the</i> golden path to success anymore, although it's a sign in the right direction. I don't think mop or the olympiad community is the summit on top of the world anymore, though I think it's a small peak in a huge mountain range. I don't think math people are the only ones I'm capable of interacting with, or who will understand me, anymore.<br>
<br>
a postive way to think of this is that I've become more open minded / less tunnel visioned; a negative way is that I've become softer. 10th grade me would be shaking her head, wondering why I've degenerated into a directionless clown like most high school seniors, and no longer have the work ethic that allowed me to get to where I am now.<br>
<br>
mop/imo invites were sent out very recently, and many of my friends made it. I'm so happy for them, that they get to spend another summer in the heaven that I once called home (and still kinda do???) they remind me of the amazing possibilities that exist out there if you try hard enough; if you continue that upward trajectory and not start crumbling in mid-junior year like I did (I did so badly on tst that I didn't partake in much of the discussion this year.)<br>
it's kinda weird, feeling really happy and nostalgic for all these young moppers while at the same time trying to convince myself that there are lots of great things beyond math competitions.<br>
<br>
I'm not quite sure if I'm just coping with my math skill issue or if I'm kinda late to an important realization... but life is definitely changing, and it feels kinda right...</div>

			<div class="message">in a way I wasn’t really expecting<br>
<br>
btw I’m typing this on phone so it’s probably lower quality than normal<br>
<br>
discotech (discover caltech) was absolutely amazing. I was blown away by how kind people are. the students are probably (definitely) drowning in work, but they still smile and really enjoy it there, and really made an effort to interact with the prefrosh. (unlike mit cpw, in which I feel like students and even hosts generally kinda ignored the prefrosh)<br>
<br>
when I arrived, my host brought me to meet some of her friends who were so chill and cool. we probably had like a 1 hour long convo about their experiences at caltech and about math (both of the friends were math majors) and they were so willing to talk even though they probably had a lot of work. afterward one of the friends offered to give me a tour of the dorm they were staying in, and basically all the dorms have rly cool murals on the walls. but the coolest part was that the person giving the tour stopped at many rooms to chat with the people in them, and we got some free room tours. everyone seemed really friendly and like they all knew each other (which they did because the community is so small)<br>
<br>
also, at caltech people don’t seem to be like <i>obsessed</i> with their school, and they don’t flex it or anything. (at least much less than at certain other schools). however, they really like it deep down inside.<br>
<br>
during discotech we actually went to some VERY COOL places like Mt. Wilson Observatory, Jet Propulsion Labratories, and Griffith Observatory, in which we got to learn about science because basically all of them were museums. we also learned a lot about caltech and went to many different labs in caltech. I feel like I didn’t really learn about mit at cpw.<br>
<br>
but mostly, the reason why I love caltech now is the people; what I talked about first. I definitely didn’t know until I actually visited. they’re by far the friendliest college students I’ve met (as a whole). so many nice and super smart people who didn’t do lots of math comps in middle/high school, (but many of who are still very passionate about math and want to do math research), and that shows that the comp math community isn’t the only source of cool people. if I went to mit, I’d have a hard time separating myself from the mopper crowd and meeting new people who I didn’t already know in high school, just because I’m suchhhh good friends with many of the moppers. I’ve made sooooo many more new friends at discotech than I did at mit cpw.<br>
<br>
and I feel like I should expand my world view at some point, and learn to appreciate other sciences and subjects (and people who main them) like I do math. I can’t obsess over olympiad math forever, at some point I’ll have to (and want to) start exploring other math topics, and try out research. and it’ll be much easier to make those transitions at caltech. support from faculty is also unparalleled there. I don’t have anything against the math community or Olympiad math; I’ll definitely still interact with the math community and do some Olympiad math. I just want to explore beyond the walls of my comfort zone a bit.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">one drawback about caltech is that the admission process is kinda questionable T_T but that’s kinda unrelated to the actual experience as a student</span><br>
<br>
these are just my opinions, and other people will have different views on this. but yeah I’m almost definitely going to caltech now and there is no going back.<br>
<br>
@everyone OF COURSE I WONT FORGET YALL!!!</div>

			<div class="message">CMIMC... the first college comp I ever attended back in 5th grade since it was just a block away from my school which happened to be sending a team-- <i>and during which I was utterly petrified and had basically no clue what was going on</i>-- ... and now the last college comp I'll ever attend as a contestant, surrounded by friends and multipurposing this as a chance to relive old memories from a very good time.<br>
<br>
honestly, out of all the college comps I've been to, CMIMC is probably my favorite, in terms of how it's run. I'm totally not biased-- but just so many things about it are just how I like (of course this is just my opinion though)
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>(the most important thing) amazing staff members. like absolutely amazing. somehow they're just the perfect balance of everything. some can be loud, some can be really kind, some funny, some probably working like crazy in the grading rooms, but all really good-natured and none yelling <i>too</i> loudly like Ryan Leal. somehow the group of staff members was literally just the perfect team. there weren't too many of them, so it looked like everyone had a job to do, unlike HMMT in which there were so many people just standing around lmao. and there weren't too few staff members that it was too chaotic. they seemed to turn the chaotic moments into opportunities for humor, which I loved. so huge congrats to all of them for running it so successfully.</li>
<li>the difficulty and quality of the problems. CMIMC was defiintely easier than PUMaC, HMMT, CMM, and literally every other competition, and higher quality than some of them, especially PUMaC. and so unlike the others, I felt like I was actually <i>solving problems</i> during the rounds, rather than constantly panicking that I wasn't going fast enough. feeling like you're doing okay is actually a huge confidence boost and helps you think a lot. CMIMC also felt a little more like a speed contest than a deep-thinking contest, but personally I'm better at speed LOL. and also basically all the problems (at least the indiv ones) were really clean and non-bashy, which I loved.</li>
<li>free time in the schedule... some competitions like HMMT don't have this and taking breaks is actually really helpful for focus + it's nice to have free time for exploring the campus</li>
<li>pretty easy to find stuff... I'm pretty familiar with the CMU campus so ig I can't really speak on this but it was nice that everything was in the same couple of rooms and we didn't spend forever wandering around looking for our rooms</li>
</ul>
so yeah... this might also be why I pop off more on CMIMC than other competitions. I think the way it's run is just better catered to my strengths or smth. (oh and also a lot of the cracked ppl don't come lol, like lehigh + alphastar)<br>
<br>
anyway it was really really fun to see everyone! and it was so nice that we had breaks because we'd wander around and see soooo many people we knew <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> I think it would've felt different if I didn't live in Pittsburgh because the very sight of CMU would bring back so many nostalgic, happy memories-- I just don't see it the same way as the other moppers do, cuz it's too regular a sight ;-; but oh well lol<br>
<br>
it's really really sad that I won't be going to any more college comps as a contestant <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> these were literally where I met so many of my friends for the first time in-person, which were some of the best days of my life. and it was so fun just being able to wander around with other kids for a full day, navigating places by ourselves (aka following everyone else), and struggling with math but bonding as people. oh and the days before and after, which have been excuses to hang out with my friends even more since we were already in the same place... college comps will always have a very very special place in my heart.<br>

first of all, im still trying to figure out what to do with my time rn. some ppl are saying to just enjoy these few months before college, and honestly "enjoying life" just means doing oly geo for me. but at the same time I feel like I would be more productive doing something else, like learning higher math (reading napkin or smth), learning another skill like coding, maybe doing project euler? so maybe I'll try these other things out, like in the summer, <strike>but as you can see I'm currently procrastinating :skull:</strike> anyway no matter what I must continue learning something or else I'll get really bored.<br>
<br>
speaking of getting bored, what do graduated seniors/incoming college freshmen even do during that summer???<br>
I'm going to TA at G2 but that's literally only 2 weeks out of the entire 3-4 month summer. I reached out to a couple other math camps to see if I can TA/be a counselor but many of them conflict with G2 and/or I wouldn't be a legal adult for the entirety of them. I might apply to non-trivial... but yeah I rly gotta figure out what to do during the summer soon, and a lot of applications and stuff are closing rly soon.<br>
<br>
I also want to spend some time with my family... <strike>or maybe its more like vice versa...</strike> (my sister rly wants to spend time with me and literally gets so sad whenever college is mentioned; I feel kinda bad but like my life has to go on T_T)<br>
<br>
I also got my last college admission result today lolll so now I have to make a choice in the next month. it's actually crazy that in a month I'll know so much more about my future. I've always thought it was so far away in the distance, but not anymore<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">college stuff</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I got rejected from a bunch of places (princeton, stanford, harvard, duke). I think I'm just really not well-rounded enough for the ivies LOL my application was literally just math-related stuff and they don't want sticks, they want circles! so yeah they were looking for a certain type of applicant which was definitely not me. I guess that shouldn't be surprising. but also I'm not very sad about this because I probably wouldn't want to go to one of those even if I was accepted. I just don't vibe with the culture very well.<br>
<br>
I somehow got accepted to caltech and mit, so am choosing between those two... this is a pretty hard decision. assuming they both cost the same (my dad said that if one costs more than the other, u can convince the more expensive one to meet the other one's price) and that these are the only options:<br>
<br>
<b>pros of caltech:</b>
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>I wouldn't be with any of my math/mop friends (but can prob still interact with them on discord), which could actually be a good thing because then I'd be able to make friends who aren't very similar to the people I interacted with in high school. I would learn that math ppl aren't the only interesting people who exist, and that math isn't the only important skill. because in real life, it really isn't.</li>
<li>no peer pressure from the math community (I wouldn't feel constantly nudged in the direction that a lot of my math friends are going in)</li>
<li>more freedom to do whatever I want because there are so few people, each of whom is quite different and should make different decisions.</li>
<li>easier to stand out, which can be helpful for making connections</li>
<li>I would be able to help organize CMM and hopefully make sure it's decent quality, and maybe write some problems for it too.. if I went to MIT I'd probably just be standing in a corner doing barely anything for the whole competition cuz there are just sooo many volunteers there</li>
<li>people seem friendly, and not like super competitive. it's a very tight-knit community so you kinda know everyone in your grade, and everyone is kinda friends</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>pros of mit:</b>
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>a lot of my friends are there</li>
<li>it'll be a bit easier to stay in touch with the math/mop community since most of them will be really close by-- maybe also easier to become mop staff eventually? idk how that process works</li>
<li>maybe more opportunities? more ppl at the school -&gt; generally more opportunities</li>
<li>i'll be able to see more of my friends who would still be in high school, as more ppl go to hmmt than cmm</li>
<li>according to college rankings, mit is better, and also probably more prestigious in many peoples' eyes (including all the wechat parents) (I actually dont care about ranking tho)</li>
<li>I wouldn't "vanish from the world" as some say happens to ppl who go to caltech</li>
<li>easier to get hired as a quant but tbh idk if I want to become a quant LOL</li>
<li>closer physically to my family, but actually it wouldn't really be cheaper to travel since spirit airlines goes to LAX</li>
</ul>
<br>
tldr; at caltech I can start a new life, while at mit I'd kinda continue my past one<br>
<br>
I will say though, that literally all the admissions processes were really scuffed this year, with mit being the least bad but still bad. a lot of ppl who were rly deserving of places got rejected from them, and I'm really questioning whether colleges are actually looking for talent at this point. I feel like a lot of them are not-- they're looking for ppl who spent high school grinding ec's and doing what they thought would look good on an application, rather than really exploring their interests and doing what they enjoyed. some people probably enjoyed it, but others were just squishing themselves into a box that didn't really fit them. (and ofc the ao's are also looking for certain demographics to make their pie chart look nice.) but yeah it seemed realllllly rng this year and I'm really sorry for anyone who got the short end of the stick T_T</div> (spoilered because I don't want to give ppl ptsd so plz read at ur own risk T_T)</div>

			<div class="message">it's over. the adrenaline, the nervousness, the comparing of solutions after we exit the test room, the fear of fakesolving that sets in hours later, the pain of scuffed rubrics...<br>
<br>
I kinda crashed and burned. on my very last usamo, I got the lowest of all my usa(j)mo scores, and <b>failed to solve a geo</b>. a literal p2 geo. one that was definitely doable, <i>actual 100% synthetic geo</i>, and even right up my alley-- I love spiral sim lmao-- but for some reason my brain just decided to stall----<br>
<br>
and so my last memory of the usa(j)mo will be failing to solve a geo problem.<br>
<br>
just like how the very first olympiad problem I did was a geo problem that I definitely struggled for hours on-- it's kinda come full circle.<br>
<br>
it's like I've been on a plane flight for these past couple of years and just landed. I think I might've been superhuman for a short while, up in the air. I honestly have no idea how I solved 5 problems last usamo, gotten even close to the blue cutoff let alone more than it, or solved any of the p3/6's I solved in other contests. maybe it was the high altitude that made things weird. because right now, that seems unimaginable. now, I relate more to my 9th grade self; still on the ground, fighting to push off. p2/5's still look really intimidating, and p3/6's impossible. I still tunnel vision horribly and get extremely nervous when there's little time left, just as I did during mop tests in 2022. I still make mistakes. I still beat myself up for not solving problems I should be able to solve.<br>
<br>
I've come so far, but at the same time, I'm still the exact same person.<br>
<br>
<i>random thought: doing well on an oly is a huge confidence boost. only now I've realized how much confidence I got from oly-- it was probably like 80% of my confidence. it's just so rewarding to pour so much effort into something and see it come to fruition. I'm gonna need to find another source of confidence now lmao</i><br>
<br>
lastly, something absolutely crazy is that a lot of my friends either made IMO or got really close. when I was a kid, or even a few years ago, I thought IMO was like this illustrious thing that's barely even real and basically only exists for the memes. were IMO quals even real people, or gods? or fictional characters? did they do anything besides math all day long? but here I am, in a group chat which will be 40% IMO quals soon. and they are real people, who I've known for years, who make mistakes sometimes and doubt themselves (although they shouldn't) and do think about non-math things sometimes. I'm really honored to be friends with all of these people. and it's really changed my perspective on what's possible. there are some people who can literally sweep a day of oly if they just put their mind to it. I guess a lot of oly performance is psychological. but anyway, now I've literally seen-- secondhand or something-- achievement or near-achievement of the impossible. the human's capabilities are mind-blowing.
<hr class="bbcode_rule">
so uhh.. if ur still reading.. im not a goddess or something anymore. don't expect to become better at math or anything from reading this blog. im just a normal human yapping about life. thanks for accepting me as one.
<hr class="bbcode_rule">
ok I unironically love usamo p5 now &lt;33</div>

			<div class="message">well.. in 2 days ill be basically done taking olympiads (with the exception of hmic)<br>
which feels so weird because olympiads have like defined my life for the past 4 years. ive made so many friends and had so many wonderful experiences through them. they've always given me purpose. I hope that in 2 days ill still have a purpose-- but it won't be the same. ill try to convince myself that there are still reasons to do oly, because of 1) teaching it to other ppl and 2) writing/testsolving problems, but other ppl will certainly try to convince me otherwise so ill have to drown them out. because I can't just leave so quickly. maybe slowly, very slowly, i'll let go, maybe in many years' time when all my oly friends have also graduated and work+real life actually takes up every minute of my time... but definitely not in the near future.<br>
<br>
im just gonna be so lonely without olyyyy<br>
<br>
well I have friends, but oly was my first real friend. ive spent more time on it than on basically anyone else.<br>
<br>
I was reading through messages in a dm back in 2022 and it was actually rly eye opening. I was so happy and carefree back then. there was no sense of "the end", no worry that the clock was ticking-- I was right in the middle of high school and it felt like that would never end. there was literally no real life to worry about. I rarely ever cried or was sad, because the only things I worried about were things I could (to an extent) control. and my friends were happier too-- they had dreams of eventually making mop, or imo, or egmo...<br>
<br>
and a million dreams really was all it would take.<br>
<br>
there was time, and anything was possible, so we kept dreaming<br>
<br>
maybe I should try to become more like my 2022 self right now, and just be happier with the things I have. because I <i>don't</i> have real-life things to worry about, like work, so in a sense I am still carefree. and nothing is minutely terrible right now so I really should still be optimistic.<br>
oh and one more thing: I was so much more productive in 2022 lmao; I actually had the grindset. (I think this goes along with happiness + my life having concrete purpose.) I need to get back some of that work ethic somehow <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

<br>
<b>0 (not a friendship):</b> one person regularly dms the other, <strike>often asking for math help</strike>, and the other person ghosts them every time :flushed:<br>
<b>1 (barely a friendship):</b> one person messages the other occasionally (every few days or week or so) (usually venting about their life or just randomly spamming) and the other responds occasionally with a few words but really doesn't put any thought into their response, nor really cares about the other person at all<br>
<b>2 (distant friendship):</b> you message each other occasionally, like every few days or every week, and have pretty substantial convos <strike>about math problems</strike>, but one or both people often forgets to reply and accidentally ghosts the other. you think each other are cool people, but you both are unfortunately really busy and prioritize other things over this friendship.<br>
<b>3 (somewhat close friendship):</b> you regularly interact with each other in servers or gc's, but hardly ever dm each other because you're a bit shy or don't want to bother them. you're friendly and genuinely enjoy talking to each other, but each other's well-being isn't like always at the forefront of your minds.<br>
<b>4 (close friendship):</b> you dm each other every few days and have substantial convos about stuff that's not just math, <strike>but maybe it's usually one person starting the convo because the other person doesn't put quite as much effort into the friendship (oopss).</strike> you also interact a lot in servers and gc's, enjoy talking to each other a lot and understand each other pretty well<br>
<b>5 (really close friendship):</b> you both make sure to dm each other every day, are basically constantly messaging each other, and understand each other very well<br>
<br>
usually, I think friendships become stronger when both people view it as the same level of friendship. otherwise, it might kinda get stuck in one of the lower levels.<br>
<br>
but I'm no expert on this because way too many of my "friendships" are in the 1-3 levels, ESPECIALLY 3 T_T im not very good at dm'ing ppl<br>
like I really need to put in more effort into sustaining friendships. usually the other person is putting in more effort than I am, and I'm just responding on discord but not really thinking that much about what I'm saying...<br>

I still had a good sleep schedule tho. I also fell in love with something that wasn't math. life was literally perfect this year; I don't know if a single thing could've changed to make it better.

<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>I went to mop last summer and got to know a lot of people so it was easy to recruit teachers and TA's, hence a lot more staff members than ever before :DD</li>
<li>I'm a senior, so unlike the younger kids I'm not grinding math 24/7, and also I'm not in college or go to a really hard high school (like TJ), so I generally have quite a lot of free time to run Athemath</li>
<li>I'm still pretty connected to the young math community because I go on AoPS/Discord a lot and and I'm still in high school so I can go to math competitions and meet people <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> this makes it easier to recruit students and talk to them (since the age gap is small enough that I feel comfortable talking to them)</li>

does this mean that running Athemath might not go as well next year when I go to college? I feel like it really is something that's best run by a high school senior. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> I guess I'll just have to find a successor soon <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

			<div class="message">this was a very eventful trip, in very very different ways from how hmmt was eventful<br>
it was my first public transit trip (no planes) without parents<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">friday</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I woke up at 4 and my mom drove me to the Amtrak train station (she thought it was not safe for me to take the bus and walk a couple blocks at that hour). getting on the train was pretty straightforward, and the train was actually really comfortable so I slept for a few hours and then did homework and attempted to do geo. I also ate some food that I had brought (I didn't spend any money during the trip other than transportation.) then I got off at DC (instead of going right to New Haven, I went to DC and then New Haven because it was cheaper that way).<br>
<br>
I had a 9 hour layover in DC so I decided to walk around the city. first I went to a nearby starbucks to charge my phone. <strike>unfortunately I did not order water.</strike> then I walked to the capitol and the place where all the museums were. there were soooo many museums. but I was kinda tired and hot (I didn't want to get too sweaty because I wouldn't be able to take a shower until Sunday since I wasn't going to stay in a hotel) so I didn't walk for too long. I went to the Spy Museum which my sister had suggested going to, but the admissions fee was a lot so I didn't actually go in. I ended up just walking around for a long time and taking pics of memorials. the lincoln memorial and washington monument look rly good at sunset. I also saw some really cute ducks in the lincoln memorial reflection park and took pics of them. ironically, I took way more pics the day before GiM@Y than on the actual day of the competition. I also tried to find the white house but it was behind bars so I couldn't get any pics of it.<br>
<br>
then I walked back to the train station at like 6pm and it was already so dark. the full moon looked rly good tho. in the train station, I charged my phone and called someone on discord, and then boarded the train to New Haven which was pretty straightforward. the train was pretty comfortable and I was able to get a decent amount of sleep (7 hours? questionable quality tho) which was def better than some other GiM@Y contestants. I very fortunately woke up like 20 minutes before I had to get off. then I walked to yale which took like 30 minutes, and I was like one of the first contestants there LOL</div><br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Saturday (competition)</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I eventually found my team (I only knew what like 2 of them looked like at first, but I eventually got to know all of them! &lt;33) one of the first things I noticed was that the competition logo was a TURTLE. and there were like 12 turtle plushies on the stage, which turned out to be prizes. <strike>was this holden-sponsored?!</strike> none of the organizers seemed to know Holden tho. the competition was pretty fun, I saw a lot of ppl who I recognized (including Selena, Mikayla, Maiya, Laura, Avni, Adya, Sophia, Elena) and also got to know a lot more lol. individual round was okay (somehow I only sillied one question, which was a combo I had bashed), team round was funny LOL we spent like half an hour on one problem and still didn't solve it, tiebreakers was interesting (somehow I guessed the first question which was geo and it turned out to be nice after I actually solved it), and lightning round was nerve-wracking but fun. I got a turtle plushie so this competition officially has the best prizes. also everyone was so well-behaved at GiM@Y, like there was literally 0 degen and I literally didn't lose the game a single time. sooo much different from other competitions ngl.<br>
<br>
then I thanked the organizers and walked back to the Amtrak train station, where I saw some TJ ppl, who were apparently taking the same train as me! I was getting off much earlier tho (New York) while they were getting off at DC. I mostly just went on Discord on my phone. I got on the train, and fell asleep on the train even though I had to get off pretty soon. this is where things kinda went downhill. I set an alarm for 8:40 AM instead of PM by accident, so I woke up literally 2 minutes before I had to get off OOOPSSSS that was really close. fortunately I had a pretty long layover in New York (I was supposed to get on a Greyhound bus to Pittsburgh at 11:30.) I found a place in the New York train station which was pretty quiet and had a charger, and called some ppl on Discord (and joined the Athemath NT club which was rly good shoutout to dotted!)</div><br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Saturday evening</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">unfortunately I called ppl on Discord for a little too long so I was almost late for the bus. I literally ran like 10 blocks in New York City to the Greyhound station. by the time I got there, there were only 10 minutes until the bus was supposed to leave. however, upon arriving there I realized it wasn't just a Greyhound station, it was a Port Authority station for all different types of transit. and I wayyy underestimated how big the station would be. I couldn't even find the gates for the Greyhound buses, even after asking like 10 different people (they didn't know either). eventually I called my parents at 11:30pm, almost sure that I had missed the bus. they told me to go downstairs, so I descended like 3 levels and finally at the bottom were the Greyhound bus gates. I would NOT have been able to find it without their help, because there were literally no signs for Greyhound. honestly my fault though, because I should've gotten to the station wayyyy sooner. I got there at like 11:38 and fortunately people were still boarding so I didn't miss the bus!! the bus was pretty comfortable. some guy from Mauritania was trying to talk to me (not in a creepy way, I don't think) but I said that I needed to sleep. I got like 6 solid hours of sleep!! then I got off in downtown Pittsburgh the next morning and it was literally like negatives Celsius in Pittsburgh, soooo cold. I had a bit of trouble finding the bus to go home since literally every bus stop I went to had a sign saying "buses no longer stop here, go to X other bus stop" but finally I saw a bus with my eyes, not with the phone app, and got on, so I finally went home!!!!!!!! when I got home I took a shower immediately lmao</div><br>
so yeah that was a very interesting trip and cost like $212 in total lol</div>

			<div class="message">my first and last hmmt feb<br>
<br>
soooo my team kinda got disqualified for breaking the 150 mile rule (OOPS) so we were an Individual team, resulting in us not rly trying on the team round LMAOOO<br>
also, for like all of the team-based rounds I did only geo because unlike the 2 other geo mains on my team (<b>crazyeyemoody907</b> and <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>), I can't do nongeo so I let them do the hard nongeo <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"> tysm<br>
throughout the competition the inserting of "orz" into peoples' names spread like wildfire among my team <strike>gorz fe</strike><br>
<br>
as for the individual rounds... I initially felt like I really had to do well on indiv because there was no way we were placing on team. alg/nt went okay by my standards (5) since those are my 2 worst subjects... but then geo happened and I ABSOLUTELY CHOKED. when there were like 15 minutes left, I had done 7 problems of which 6 were correct (and the 7th I was actually very unsure about) BUT THEN I STARTED TO PANIC RLY BADLY AND LITERALLY MISREAD O in problem 6 as the circumcenter of triangle ABC and spent the next 10 minutes trying to find the circumradius of ABC, finally found it, and changed my correct answer to the wrong one. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> and then I had no time to correct the other answer I was skeptical about, resulting in me getting a 5. (bad by my standards cuz im supposed to be a geo main <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">) why the heck did I have to let my nerves get to me, idk. I rly should've just kept calm. this has happened to me soooo many times lmao, like on jan tst too, I started to panic rlyyyy badly when there were like 10 minutes left and just froze. for combo I was kinda hoping to redeem myself but that didnt happen lmao. I SPENT LITERALLY 15 MINUTES ON PROBLEM 2 AND WASNT EVEN SURE OF MY ANSWER thank god I got it correct but I still only got 4.<br>
<br>
so yeah individual rounds were meh<br>
but the rest of the competition was rly fun<br>
we did decently on guts I think (other ppl on my team carried; I didn't do much :flushed:)<br>
we spent forever trying to find pizza for lunch because kept stopping to talk to ppl lolll (I saw sooooo many ppl and there are still more ppl I hoped to meet but didn't)<br>
wandering around the awards ceremony room and talking to ppl was fun<br>
after the awards ceremony were like 2352352 different meetups. fortunately a lot of them (mop, athemath, g2) were in the same place, however the awards ceremony ended late so we couldn't go to <b>kevinmathz</b> and <b>mathicorn</b>'s dinner and they were kinda mad at us oopssss. we talked to some moppers, briefly got interviewed by <b>MathJams</b> which was rly cool, discovered a small secret passageway in MacGregor, and then almost froze while walking around boston in the dark but it was fun!!!!!<br>
<br>
on sunday not as many ppl were there <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> but I visited Next House, did geo with <b>crazyeyemoody907</b>, went to the last part of the origami lecture, walked around Boston a lot, discovered that Apple Stores have good wifi and free computers to do stuff like geo on, and said goodbye to some of my friends <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">, before going to the airport.<br>
upon returning home, I got a 2am virtual tour of Next House lol
<hr class="bbcode_rule">
the saddest part was that I don't know when I'll see a lot of these people next. in the past, it's always been like "cya at hmmt" or "cya at smt" or "hope to cya at mop" but it's not like that anymore. instead, it's like "hope to cya around" but no meeting time/place are for certain. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> but im sure that ill run into y'all every once in a while, and we can always make it happen if we so desire.<br>
<br>
so thus begins the <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">7 week period</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">well except for girls in math at yale but that's a pretty small competition</div> of not seeing any of yall in-person T_T, and stressing my *** off about a certain bloodbath called March. I don't even want to think about the 3 billion possibilities that could happen, because some of them would drive me to tears of joy, and many more, tears of sadness. and every single one of them would change my life so drastically from what it is now, I can't even wrap my brain around it. I don't want to believe that anything's for certain, or that some things are not for certain, so I just wish it would disappear from my head... but it's hurtling toward us at ludicrous speed... <i>hold on, just let us escape... and fly away tonight...</i></div>

<br>
ok honestly my days vary a LOTTTT so this will be pretty hard<br>
<br>
<b>5:00-6:30</b> wake up; I have an alarm for 6:30 but sometimes wake up before that. if I wake up before that then I often just lie in bed until 6:30 on discord or instagram or smth :skull:<br>
<b>6:30-7:00</b> make breakfast for my family and eat breakfast<br>
<b>7:00-7:45</b> do hw if I need to, otherwise check discord / do math. and brush teeth, wash face, put on contacts<br>
<b>7:55-8:10</b> bike to school<br>
<b>8:15-9:35</b> first period; I usually pay attention to class so nothing much interesting goes on here<br>
<b>9:40-10:40</b> free period, but occasionally there's a meeting or smth to attend or run. so basically discord / math / hw or athemath work if I have to do any<br>
<b>10:40-12:00</b> second period; also quite boring<br>
<b>12:00-12:45</b> lunch; basically same as free period earlier but I spam discord / messages more because more ppl are awake, and also I eat lunch<br>
<b>12:45-2:00</b> third period; also quite boring<br>
<b>2:00-3:00</b> free period again (so same stuff as morning free period and lunch), but sometimes I have to do things like meetings or visiting the middle school mathcounts club<br>
<i>*my school is weird and sometimes flips third period and the last free period around</i><br>
<b>3:10-3:30</b> bike home from school<br>
<b>3:35-3:50</b> take a shower<br>
<b>3:50-6:00</b> this is basically just free time so I do math or spam discord or other messaging platforms, or do Athemath work if it's really urgent. I never ever do hw during this time though because I just really don't feel like it <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"> and also traditionally this has been "math time" so I have a greater inclination to do math<br>
<b>6:00-7:00</b> dinner (this takes so long because im often talking with family)<br>
<b>7:00-10:15</b> more free time. usually I spend a lot of it spamming discord :flushed: because people are so active on discord at this time. sometimes I get carried away with math though (but my brain turns off at like 9:30). sometimes I have meetings, but usually not unless it's during the Athemath season. sometimes I do hw, but only if I have to since I prefer to do it before or during school, and im also worse at doing writing-based things late at night<br>
<b>10:15 ish</b> sleep<br>
<br>
not mentioned: sometimes waking up in the middle of the night because I can't sleep, and getting on discord for like half an hour :skull:<br>
<br>
that was like very un-specific but honestly my days vary a lot... also it's quite late right now so im not very good at flushing out thoughts and this was written very hastily</div>

			<div class="message">some bullet points since I got lazy:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>I'm oddly not very busy right now (my rate of posting on HSO loosely correlates with how busy I am)</li>
<li>I’ve been doing more math at school (in free periods) than outside of school, and have become a little obsessed with asy’ing diagrams for the more complicated problems-- its actually so fun and aesthetic <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley">. after school, especially after dinner, I feel lazy and more like spamming discord than actually being productive :skull:</li>
<li>I got a 12 on the AIME, <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">distrib</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">11111 01111 10110</div>. so all of my AIME <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">scores</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">3 6 (9 9) 9 12 12 12</div> are 0 mod 3! honestly I was expecting to bomb this aime cuz im soooo rusty at computational, as can be seen from my cmm flop <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"> but fortunately aime is much easier and higher quality than cmm</li>
<li>I’m obsessed with Alan Walker songs right now. Ignite, The Spectre, Darkside, Big Universe, etc &lt;33 (ok but why are none of the old instrumental songs on Spotify, they're the best <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">)</li>
<li>rly looking forward to HMMT!!</li>
</ul>
for some reason my mind is oddly blank right now. I didn’t post for a week because I didn’t have any compelling ideas to post about. now that I think about it, I’ve kinda always suffered from <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">blankness</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">this wallpaper is “Disfigure - Blank” by the way <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"></div> of mind. unlike the other geo mains, I don’t really write my own problems T_T. however, <b>i</b> <b>l</b>ove <b>t</b>estsolving <b>g</b>eo!<br>
<br>
in fact, I’ve always been pretty uncreative. I clearly remember a time when I was very young, maybe like 8 or so, and my brother was thinking of all these wild ideas for inventions (he read a lot of science books) and my mom (who's also cracked at science) was questioning why I didn’t have lots of ideas and questions about the world like he did. so I tried my best to list out such ideas and questions, but I couldn’t. :///<br>
random but I wish I knew more about science, and how the world worked. my brother literally has the entire encyclopedia in his brain; he knows random facts about literally everything. and same with my parents, basically. so dinner table discussions are almost always about random science things they’re curious about LOL.<br>
<br>
on the other hand, my brain has such a small volume that any random fact I learn escapes within a couple hours or days. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> and honestly, I don’t have as much of an affinity for science than them; I’m more interested in people. since I was really young, given a choice between a science book and a biography, I’d always choose the biography. :skull: maybe my lack of passion for science is related to my brother being super super good at it and thus always feeling incompetent myself <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> but I definitely do hope to learn more science someday because it seems so so useful.<br>
<br>
I wish I could see the world like them; looking at a block of wood or piece of food and being able to visualize the molecules inside and how they fit together; seeing through the outer plating of a car and into the parts of its engine; being able to look at a computer and know how the circuits work inside. it must be so nice to be able to answer your own questions with logical reasoning and your x-ray vision, instead of consulting the Internet or a human expert. it must be so nice to have the world actually make sense.</div>

			<div class="message">or maybe it’s that lack of success is really demotivating? but anyways<br>
lucking out early on and qualifying for something even though you don’t think you deserved it will get you a lot of impostor syndrome at first, but then a huge burst of motivation to “prove yourself” which will lead to you improving a lot (and proving yourself).<br>
<br>
meanwhile, without this stroke of luck you won’t get this motivational boost, and maybe you’ll even have less motivation (the it’s-all-over effect). you can still have motivation from just wanting to learn more though, which is in fact the best type of motivation, but also harder to obtain in my opinion<br>
<br>
so yeah luck plays a very large factor in math contests-- it can determine whether you get achievements and extra motivation, or neither. I think a lot of my motivation, especially early on, has been from accidentally qualifying for things. if not for this, I’d have had a much harder time improving, and a much higher chance of giving up along the way. tbh I really admire people who didn’t have many accomplishments early on, but kept trying because of the possibility of success later.<br>

			<div class="message">first of all, after getting TST scores today, I’m almost certain that I didn’t make EGMO, probably getting 5th place. it was a painful realization at first (having made it for the past 2 years, this really feels like <i>falling off</i>, and I’m no longer going to end on a high note), but honestly, I’ve been twice already, and it would be nice for someone else to have the eye-opening experience. each EGMO is about the same, except the location has a slightly different vibe and the people are different (but they’re always very cool). also, I’d get a chance to go to SMT or something, which is on the same weekend. that’ll probably be my last college competition.<br>
<br>
honestly, the worst part about not making it is not having an excuse to do oly anymore. I can’t tell my parents that I’m preparing for an oly anymore, because am I really? none of the olys really matter anymore. now I really empathize with many of the other seniors, battling this chronic illness called being lost, trying to find meaning when it’s scarce. math used to be for fun, but also for making connections through. now it’s really just for fun.<br>
<br>
which brings me to a certain incident that happened 2 days ago…<br>
<br>
a nightmare came true, kinda. something that confirmed the dreaded reality I’ve known all this time but never quite wanted to admit: geo is a solved subject. it’s bashable, and everything can easily be confirmed or counterproven. there are a finite number of options at every step. it’s not open-ended like other types of math; it’s all been excavated already. someone has a map of all of it in their head, and they’re an AI.<br>
<br>
with so little novelty to uncover, and now with software capable of solving it that could possibly enable people to cheat in-contest, it’s natural that the amount of geo on contests will decrease. or at least classic Euclidean geo, with circles and triangles and angle chasing; the type of geo that I associated my identity with for &gt;3 years; the part of the world that I loved the most for many years; and also probably my biggest skill; it was all soon going to become obsolete. it was as if geo had turned into sudoku; some enjoyable puzzle that doesn’t have much practical purpose and that can be solved pretty easily by some website online.<br>
<br>
I couldn’t bear to let it go. that day felt like a really painful breakup, and I cried for half an hour. then my parents lectured me (basically saying that’s what you get for focusing too much on one subject) and my friends had mixed reactions, some really happy and some somewhat happy and some not surprised at all and some (but very few) sad.<br>
<br>
but then something really weird happened. something clicked in my brain, and the geo addiction switch, which had been on for years, flipped off. all of a sudden, for the first time in years, I had the urge to do nongeo. so I went on HSO, removed the geometry filter, and did some easy combo problems. often, I only do things when I’m forced to, and this was the world forcing me to stop doing so much geo. of course I will do a bit though, because I still love it, but I’ll be more open to trying other subjects I guess.<br>
unfortunately this realization came a bit late though, because all the competitions that matter are over…<br>
<br>
with this huge part of my identity being toned down by 50%, I can hardly recognize myself anymore. I’m changing faster than I can control it, and I have no idea what’s happening. but life is a rollercoaster after all, so maybe it’s okay for it to turn upside down sometimes.</div>

			<div class="message">first of all I slipped (on ice?) while biking to school, and scraped my knees and face. part of me thinks this was the world warning me to <i>be careful, because this is going to be rough</i>.<br>
<br>
and I didn’t.<br>
<br>
after glancing at the problems I concluded that the first two were both combo, and breathed a sigh of relief. if either of them were NT or alg, I’d actually be screwed. (I <i>had</i> to get two problems today.) so for them both to be combo, meant I actually had a chance to get both. and I absolutely had to. it was as if the world was testing me. an opportunity was dangling under my nose, and I just had to seize it.<br>
<br>
the first problem was fine; it took me like 1.5 hours to solve and write up. the second problem very suspiciously only took me 0.5 hours to solve and write up, and then I spent the remaining time trying the third problem (an fe) and failing. like literally failing-- I got nowhere, not even the step a lot of people got. a painful reminder of my alg skissue.<br>
<br>
while working on the third problem, I was pretty sure I had done the first two correctly. I don’t know why I was so sure…<br>
<br>
but when there were ~7 minutes left, I finally thought of maybe looking over my other two solutions. I skimmed over the first problem and everything seemed fine. then I got to the second problem, with its mysteriously short solution that made it wayyyy easier than problem 1… and suddenly I remembered… during 2021 JMO Day 2, when I had misread problem 5 and fakesolved it, having solved a way easier problem than the actual one.<br>
<br>
no way that exact same thing could’ve happened again… right?<br>
a knot of dread formed and I held my breath<br>
<br>
and then I realized something fatal that I had overlooked in my solution: <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">spoiler</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I had assumed the geometric progression had an integer common ratio</div>.<br>
then I basically stopped breathing for a minute as I watched my hopes and dreams crumble into dust.<br>
<br>
I could’ve fixed the mistake right then and there, if I had actually been thinking, but for the last few minutes my brain went into ultra panic mode and became paralyzed. I think I found a way to patch the mistake like 2 minutes after the test though. if only I had just stayed calm…<br>
<br>
why did I have to butcher that perfect chance?<br>
I swear I’m going to be like the only person who didn’t solve problem 5 lol… it was way misplaced imo…<br>
<br>
you’d think I’d have learned my lesson to <i>actually read over my solutions</i> after fakesolving <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">MANY</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>2021 JMO 5</li>
<li>2022 EGMO 5</li>
<li>2022 TSTST 1 (well ok everyone fakesolved this)</li>
<li>2023 MIMO 1</li>
<li>more problems on mop tests that I forgot</li>
<li>and now this, 2024 TST 5…<br>
<br>
also why are like 4/5 of these NT</li>
</ul></div> problems in-contest…<br>
… but I guess not <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
anyway, I was <i>really</i> disappointed in myself when I left school after the tst. but outside was like the most beautiful sunset I had ever seen-- blended shades of blue, purple, and pink up above, and then orange and yellow around the horizon. it was almost as if the world was trying to comfort me. the surrealness of the sky and the surrealness of that disastrous tst experience seemed to go hand in hand in a weird way, as if neither could be reality.<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">---</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I don’t really know what’s going to happen next, but I feel there’s a large chance I’m going to lose my reputation as someone who’s good at math. honestly I haven’t grinded math <i>seriously</i> since the end of 10th grade, so I kinda deserve this. I shouldn’t expect to qualify for things if I don’t put in the effort. but to have it actually happen, rather than just half-seriously joked about, is kinda frightening.<br>
<br>
I think I’ve kinda enjoyed the status of “someone who’s kinda good at math” for 2 years, and I’ve kinda gotten used to it, almost forgetting how precious it was, and making it almost all of my identity. but now it’s crumbling, and I need to find something else to be my identity.<br>
<br>
you only realize how precious something is once it’s gone.</div><br>

Edit: I think this mistake cost me EGMO</div>

			<div class="message">I don’t think the word “break” is in my parents’ dictionary— my dad goes on business trips giving talks every single day that he doesn’t have to teach at CMU, and hence is never at home during holidays. my mom has online meetings at midnight and 6am on some days (and like a lot of the rest of the day too) and thus cannot possibly get enough sleep. they both work every hour of the day— we’ve never had family outings or played games or really done anything as a family together, other than when I was really young, because of this. I literally never see my parents do anything for their own pleasure, except for like very occasionally playing a game with my sister, but that’s just to make her happy, not themselves. I know they really care about us, but they also really care about their work, which they’re trying to make the world better through. but the more I think about this the more I realize how wrong it is to do things for my own pleasure.<br>
<br>
I should really help my mom with housework or something because she’s so busy, but in the past whenever I’ve tried this she’s always told me to go study instead. (maybe this has changed now though.) but anyways the least I can do is <i>actually</i> study (or be productive). I really need to stop wasting time (i.e. spending too much time on instagram/discord or drawing or doing origami etc), or else my heart’s going to fall out.</div>

			<div class="message">this year, I want to be happier-- maybe more consistently instead of lots of ups and downs like 2023 was. ive had pretty high stress for the second half of 2023 and I think much of the reason behind this was procrastination. like for months on the most trivial things; it was really bad. although I tell myself that I can ignore something until later, it's still lingering in the back of my mind, and so my mind is filled with lots of little painful thoughts which build up into a nonstop ache (figuratively). I guess procrastination really does take a toll on your mental health.<br>
so yeah, I kinda want to stop procrastinating, but this will be hard.<br>
and I also want to finally figure out what I'm doing with my life, after flailing around for the past year or so.<br>
<br>
last day of college apps ahhhhhhhhh and then I'll be so so free but I also have to catch up on things I've been procrastinating for a long time (most of which are athemath-related) and prepare for the tst which I'm kinda losing my mind over (I haven't done math in a week)<br>
<br>
<i>I’ve had a pretty sweet childhood-- surrounded by loving people, and constantly dreaming big; the universe hardly letting me down. Looking back, I can think of barely anything that could’ve changed to make it better. And I just can’t seal those halcyon years into an envelope and stow it away quite yet; the urge to steal another gaze, in case adulthood is not as beautiful, lucky, and mellifluous, is simply too strong.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I’m just being optimistic-- there definitely are knots in the storyline, but I like to believe that they’re for the better. Performing worse than expected is a wake-up call to stop slacking; a reminder that no matter how high, there are always peaks above you. Even not getting into your dream school is a chance to be a slightly bigger fish in a slightly smaller pond; hence a wider range of opportunities. By focusing on the silver linings, I’ve convinced myself that there’s always a glimmer of hope. However, although it’s helped me to enjoy and appreciate life, this outlook has its flaws-- so many people in this world give it their all, and still await compensation.</i></div>

			<div class="message">at the beginning of 2023, I thought it would be the year in which I change the most. I thought that at the end of 2023 I’d be no longer addicted to geometry, actually have an idea of how the world works and know what I want to do with my life, have all my college apps under control, perhaps even know what college I’ll be going to…<br>
<br>
I thought the world would completely flip upside down in 2023.<br>
<br>
well none of those things actually happened <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> I’m actually still very similar to one year ago, except maybe 1) slightly better at writing essays, and 2) I don’t spend quite as much time on math as I used to, because I simply can’t? but I really changed much less than expected. probably a similar amount to how I changed in 2022.<br>
<br>
I do feel like 2023 was split into many different phases though.
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li><b>Jan-Mar: Grinding</b><br>
most of my friends (including me…? kinda…?) were like grinding really hard for USA(J)MO and many rarely even went on discord. But despite low interaction, this time period was still awesome, like I was rly rly satisfied with life. it felt so wholesome and <i>meaningful</i>.</li>
<li><b>Apr-May: Wasting Time</b><br>
after USA(J)MO, people were on discord MUCH more. I would spend some afternoons just spamming in Tea Shop and not doing any math :flushed: despite slacking on math, life was still very enjoyable though esp because I could talk to my friends more. there was also that period of a few days before the AP’s when I woke up at 4am every day to watch crash course videos and uhh LONG STORY SHORT CRAMMING DID NOT WORK</li>
<li><b>June: <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"></b><br>
best month of my life; happiness spiked by 100x &lt;3 <span style="color:transparent">: ) &lt;3</span></li>
<li><b>July-Aug: noooo junior year’s over</b><br>
I went to SPARC and G2, but couldn’t stop thinking about how junior year was over so I was now a…. senior…? what the heck no way. I didn’t know if I was supposed to continue grinding math, or slow down, or stop. I ended up slowing down a tiny bit. I just really was not ready to let go of math. I was extremely nostalgic for junior year during this time period (and still am). also post-mop sadness :’)</li>
<li><b>Sep-Nov: wth am I doing with my life</b><br>
these months passed so quickly because of school and everything. I honestly wasn’t really sure what I was doing with my life, but just went with the flow and everything went… okay…? I did like epsilon college apps during this time and still did a bit of math for fun</li>
<li><b>Dec: Storm</b><br>
the first two weeks were really sad and stressful because many of my friends (including me, kinda) were losing their minds over a certain college result happening in mid-Dec. after that things kinda calmed down for a week (also winter break which was relaxing) and I actually got time to do math but then around Dec 27th a huge storm hit aka the realization that college apps were due in a few days and I’ve been grinding like he// since then. I think I still have my sanity though</li>
</ul>
but now I’m sure that 2024 will be the year in which I change the most. I don’t even know if I’ll recognize myself one year from now.</div>

			<div class="message">I can't write anymore<br>
writing about a fixed (very boring) topic in a fixed style, I mean. except I can’t just state the facts, I have to somehow weave creativity into it. if there is no creativity, it sounds like trash, like an 8 year old wrote it. and if there is too much creativity, it looks like I just started randomly writing for fun and got carried away. I need a syringe to measure out the correct amount of creativity, and I lost the syringe.<br>
<br>
so I’m currently writing this to take a break from college apps :vomit: :vomit: :vomit: blog posts are so much better because you can just write whatever you want. I haven’t been writing blog posts recently because 1) ive been using all my <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">writing battery</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I don’t think I have a math battery</div> on college essays and 2) I thought my previous post was cringe so I just didn’t check this for a whole week so I wouldn’t die of cringe oopssss<br>
<br>
<i>help why is that one quote from alifenix- getting more and more relatable</i><br>
<br>
nowadays I really really really really miss 10th-11th grade. back then, I would basically work on math from sunup to sundown<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">,</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">like I would literally wake up at 4am and be productive for a whole extra 3 hours compared to now idk how the heck I did that</div> without feeling guilty that I wasn’t spending time on other things. I was making new friends, life had so much meaning back then! not like it doesn’t have meaning now, but it had so much more back then. back then, my friends weren’t all half-depressed! we all seemed so much happier!<br>
<br>
I felt like I actually belonged to a community (OTIS). there haven’t been many times in my life when I felt like I actually belonged to a community, but the main two I can think of are OTIS (the entirety of 10th-11th grade) and MOP (11th and the first half of 12th grade). I wouldn’t count Athemath because leading something is very different from feeling like you belong to it. to me, belonging to a community is something like being similar to its average member in various aspects, including age (which is why I don’t really feel like I belong to those aforementioned communities anymore). but not belonging doesn’t imply obligation to leave, so ofc I won’t leave them.<br>
<br>
I absolutely love being average though. one of the many reasons why MOP 2023 was my favorite experience ever was because I actually felt average for once.<br>
sometimes I really wish I was more average, because then I could belong more.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">tbh one of the reasons why I post on HSO is to meet people (has kinda been working). I kinda wish I had more friends.</span><br>

			<div class="message">I’ve been thinking, that geometry has served me the same purpose in high school as flash ftw did in middle school. both were kinda educational and kinda social. both got me extremely addicted. both showed me how much fun math could be (in very different ways), especially when you do it with others. both enabled me to meet some of the coolest math people (for some reason my best friends now are geo mains, I wonder why) and forge some very deep connections. both were what I looked forward to, and spent hours on, every day. both have, at some point, been my favorite thing in the world.<br>
<br>
however, both were also arguably very impractical uses of time. any sane math person would NOT spend their days on flash ftw, or on hso geo. instead, they would be grinding actual mathcounts papers, and olympiads containing various subjects. flash ftw has literally no point after middle school (no more countdown rounds), and geometry has no point after high school (college math is geo-less). so far, I’ve been pursuing joy much more than practicality. but I’ve also always been having a lot of fun.
<hr class="bbcode_rule">
here, the road splits: the first path is densely populated, almost guarantees you happiness and success, and feels like home. the second path is traversed by the occasional wanderer looking for a new life, but mostly ignored, mostly for its unfamiliarity-- it feels nothing like home.<br>
<br>
but no one really knows what the second path holds. although it’s nothing like the first, there will definitely be opportunities to find something that lights up your life. not flash ftw or oly geo-- <i>at some point you have to leave all thoughts of the world you knew before</i>-- but something else. hopefully both educational and social. hopefully you can meet your best friends through it. you'll find a new home. and hopefully, it’s practical. it might take a bit of time to find-- like that period of time in 8th-9th grade when I realized flash ftw no longer existed-- but you will find it.<br>
<br>
I think I’ll choose the second one.</div>

			<div class="message">all our lives, there’s been this glass wall separating us from adulthood. we’ve pondered and fantasized about college and beyond, but never like it was actually reality. there’s nothing we can really do right now to change it, because of the overwhelming factor of luck, and nor did we really want to. we were perfectly happy doing what we wanted with our lives, taking advantage of the limited amount of time we’d have under a free roof, not worrying about what would come next.<br>
<br>
but now it’s inches away. the glass wall is about to break-- in the next few days, or months, or maybe already, for various members of co’24-- and the question is whether it’ll come off cleanly (satisfactory results), or shatter (unsatisfactory).<br>
<br>
something feels really wrong about it coming off cleanly. all your hard work amounting to admission into a good college, when that wasn’t even the point of your hard work; when you’d tried to think about college as little as possible throughout your life. being in a weird safe haven, rather than constantly having to defend your math skill; prove and re-prove yourself. you don’t just make mop once and it’s over; you keep trying, for tst, imo, etc. you’re never good enough, and there are always people better than you.<br>
but you get into [good college] once, and that’s it. people believe that you’re good, and so do you. there’s nothing better to reach for. you’re (for the next few years) satisfied, and that’s scary.<br>
<br>
and it shattering feels even more wrong; having all your hard work be ignored while others get rewarded for the same amount of work. your spirit literally shatters, you lose faith in society, and it seems hard to recover. but one thing is for sure: you’re not satisfied. so you keep trying to prove yourself, and maybe, hopefully, someday you will.<br>
<br>
tbh neither option seems as good as <span style="color:#f0f">being at</span> high school <span style="color:#f0f">age</span>.<br>
<br>
these are the last few days in which co’24 will just be viewed as a bunch of math lovers. soon we’ll be divided into those whose glass walls came off cleanly, and those which shattered. math skill won’t be the primary thing that defines us, but whether the ao’s liked us, and whether the rng worked.<br>
and like any major divide, this will separate us. literally.<br>
I don’t want to be separated from anyone, nor to witness the shattering of any glass. but I know it will happen, and the shards will scatter far. there will be joy, but overwhelmingly sadness. in two days, the world will turn upside down.</div>

			<div class="message">it’s possible to succeed, but it won’t be easy<br>
<br>
at least for me, I don’t think I’ve ever done well on an olympiad without putting a ton of effort into it (this might be different for other ppl tho).<br>
every single time there’s always a moment, usually around the middle-end, when I think I’m spending way longer on a problem than I should be and I’m like, <i>am I going to survive or not?</i>, my heart rate doubles, and I enter a state of extreme panic. I don’t think there was a single oly I didn’t experience this in, except maybe EGMO Day 1 this year which was just abnormally easy. usually if I find an oly easy enough that I don’t panic during it (which is rarely ever the case), it was easy for everyone and so the experience is not as satisfying.<br>
<br>
tbh this feeling of extreme panic is one of the worst pains I’ve ever felt, because the sensible thing to do is to take a break from the problem I’m working on-- sometimes coming back to it with a fresh mindset helps prevent tunnel visioning-- but that means watching the minutes count down, which makes me even more nervous<br>
<br>
also does anyone else have this issue where if you don’t make progress on a problem for ~30 minutes then your brain exits hardcore mode and you find yourself only half-working on the problem? because the other half of your brain has kinda given up-- and then it’s like sooooo much harder to make observations-- I’m constantly trying to avoid this trap<br>
<br>
so anyway, maybe this is why I’m always so nervous for olys-- because I <i>know</i> it will be difficult, and I <i>will</i> be in a state of extreme panic at some point during it. it’s kinda like waiting for a flu shot; knowing there will be pain.<br>
<br>
<b>but also, on the flip side, this is also what makes oly so fun.</b><br>
<br>
it’s not fun to achieve something without really trying, like an A on a school math test.<br>
it <i>is</i> when you put in everything you have, try as hard as you can for 4.5 hours, and out of pure sweat and tears, manifest something.<br>
<br>
it <i>is</i> when there’s a chance of missing<br>
it <i>is</i> when you’re not #1 in the country and there are always ppl to look up to and learn from<br>
it <i>is</i> when you have too many things you want to do and not enough time for all of them<br>
it <i>is</i> when you’re trying your very hardest to get into X college and aren’t sure if you have achieved it or not<br>
it <i>is</i> when you don’t have a set path to follow, and are still trying to find your way<br>
games are only fun when there’s a chance of losing.</div>

<li>darkness stirs and wakes imagination. literally, I <i>am</i> more imaginative at night. somehow my brain’s ability to make random jumps from topic to topic is enhanced at night, hence I am better at creative writing type stuff with lots of similes and metaphors, but not stuff that I actually have to use my brain for. whatever comes out doesn’t make much logical sense, but it may sound more interesting.</li>
<li>cold weather kinda makes everything seem more serious, including the clothes ppl wear and the way they act. summer / warm weather has kind of a carefree vibe, and winter the opposite. ive heard parts of the west coast has kind of a carefree vibe too-- maybe this is related?<br>
I guess the cold kinda forces you out of your own world and into reality</li>
<li>part of the reason why I was so bad at talking / public speaking when I was younger is probably that I had an issue with not being able to act serious for very long. I would often erupt into giggles at inopportune times, hindering my ability to get my point across. I had a very optimistic view on life then (I still do, but less so). anyway, I am finally able to talk for long periods without laughing, which is crucial when trying to make an impression / point.</li>
<li>some teachers <i>really</i> care about their work, to the extent that they get mildly offended when kids prioritize other things over their classes. for example my english teacher-- she’s really really passionate about her class and doesn’t like it when people have to miss class for other things, (especially stem-related things, because in her opinion english &gt;&gt; stem). I guess she just wants people to really appreciate the amount of work she puts into teaching. I mean, teaching for 1.5 hrs every 2 days and prepping for classes beforehand really <i>is</i> a lot of work, that many students underestimate...<br>
I wonder if there’s some sort of rivalry between teachers at my school for who can make kids care more about / put more effort into their classes?</li>
<li>growing up, a lot of my friends (esp ones at my school) were not the nicest, most well-behaved people. a lot of them were problem children, or were quirky, or just <i>weird</i>. this was because the nice, well-behaved, <i>normal</i> kids always had an easy time finding friends, since they were attracted to other nice, well-behaved, normal kids. they would play normal games and with normal toys and did all the things normal kids did. I, as a math nerd, was never normal, and so none of my friends were normal either. they didn’t do math, but were always somewhat strange in some way-- really shy, tomboyish, obsessed with reading, had a quick temper, or something else. back when there were no such thing as “nerds”, I was just part of that mismatched group of “weird people”.</li>
</ul>
<br>
stuff happening recently:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>math contests exist… the in-person ones are lots of fun but the next in-person one won’t be for 8 weeks (CMM! :star_struck:) math prize olympiad happened and it was pretty meh (no geo tho <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">)</li>
<li>I am NOT ready for TST. im going on a school trip next week so I probably won’t be able to do much math at all for the few days before the TST… anyway ive kinda just accepted that im not going to make EGMO again (I mean, it would be nice for someone else to get the experience of a lifetime, and if I don’t go then hopefully I can go to at least one of {SMT, MIT CPW}, which are both on the same weekend :/)</li>
<li><strike>these might be my last two weeks of happiness</strike> I guess I should enjoy not knowing what will be the outcome in mid-December. in uncertainty, there is hope.</li>

oblivion is bliss fr</div>

well not the food type, the math problem type…<br>
<br>
math problems (at least geo ones) are like escape rooms, in which you can envision the end goal but there is a mystery sequence of steps to get there. every so often you might discover something that just <i>absolutely has</i> to be useful, and that’s like entering the next room-- one step closer to the end, but with how to proceed still ambiguous.<br>
and sometimes there are many separate tunnels leading to the answer, all with their own sequences of rooms.<br>
<br>
so making a math problem is like designing an escape room. you need to make sure there’s not a trivial shortcut from start to end, and design the rooms carefully, often in backwards order, with natural segways from one room to the next. this often requires you to understand the problem setup down to its very core, so that you can see through every foot of the building.<br>
<br>
but I feel like the only configs which I really understand 1000% are the trivial and overused ones, and so I end up trying to construct escape rooms in unfamiliar buildings with only a flashlight for guidance, hoping I'll get lucky and find a workable passageway. how do people do it?</div>

			<div class="message">actually one of the most <i>interesting</i> math competition experiences I’ve had<br>
I probably heard more spoken words starting with x yesterday than I have in the entire rest of my life<br>
my team, which was made up of innocent Athemath-ers, was completely corrupted by math degen culture in a span of 12 hours (none of it was my influence)-- “orz”, “xook”, “xoink”, “rbo”, “xonk”, etc. were constantly being said<br>
the problems were also… of questionable quality (very bashy); a few of them were good tho. I somehow managed to not completely fail.<br>
some memorable moments:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>not having a proctor until the last minute</li>
<li>my teammates shouting orz at oron from a long distance away</li>
<li>losing the game multiple times on the subject tests and team round</li>
<li>getting problem 1 wrong on both subject tests</li>
<li>spending forever trying to find the chapel <strike>so that certain two people on my team could get married</strike> and then trying to take .5’s in front of it</li>
<li>my teammates somehow getting on the roof of a random Princeton building</li>
<li>not realizing the finals round was proof-based</li>
<li>running into john0512 who was lost and then my teammates screaming orz at him in a huge echo-y chamber for a solid two minutes and then john0512 finally realizing my teammate JustJen was vlogging the entire thing</li>
<li>screaming A Million Dreams, Defying Gravity, and Never Gonna Give You Up while walking in the dark to the awards ceremony</li>
<li>the quickest awards ceremony I have ever witnessed</li>
</ul>
to my teammates: you are some of the most <i>interesting</i> people I have ever met!!</div>

my parents rarely even talk about math anymore; only these things. they've changed, and I kinda can’t believe it. I wish they still talked about math. I used to think math was everything, but it really isn’t-- I guess that was just a myth I believed as a child.<br>
<br>
so many kids these days (including me) dedicate huge chunks of their childhoods to math, ending up with connections and the ability to think creatively, but not a free pass to college…<br>

I hate the word "orz". Whereas before you had to carefully craft words to express genuine admiration or friendship or gratitude or praise,  now there's a cheap one-word alternative that you can use without thinking (or meaning it). And even if it's easier to say "orz", nobody actually likes receiving it -- it gives you impostor syndrome or places you on a pedestal (person, not a statue!) -- or obliges you to say "no u", at best. So instead of saying "orz", let's say <i>thank you</i>.<br>
<span style="color:#f0f">orz -n</span><br>
<br>
Thank you, v, for always being open to chat even as the so very accomplished math olympian you are. For ranting about how you waste time on Discord, while actually making yourself accessible and friendly to the youngest and most immature of mathletes. (For tolerating old me's blog post comments (surprised I'm not banned!) and willingly testsolving for me even when I've never done a thing for you.) For constantly posting solutions to random geo problems on hso as though you're newly in love, reminding us how beautiful geo is in a world that has forgotten geo (GEO IS GONE). For being a trailblazer in the competition math gender divide and showing the next generation of girls how wonderful math can be. If the AO's dismiss you for doing too much math (but doing it <i>so darn well</i>, and completely changing this <i>entire world</i> that is competition math to be less toxic and encouraging for younger students and girls), then screw them. Doing beautiful things that you love and helping others realize their potential -- isn't that the best thing we can do in this world? Forget college X and high paying job Y if they don't value [you for doing] these things.<br>
<br>
Thank you for always wearing a smile on your face even when it hurts your face to keep smiling. We don't acknowledge it enough, but let's take a moment to do so right now. As the community, let's take just a moment out of our day to shower gratitude and happiness over this amazing person to whom we are so greatly indebted. <span style="color:transparent">esp me -n</span><br>

Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br>

also the stress about college is just getting more and more real-- the worst thing about it is that there’s nothing that can be done; on december 16th I’m either going to be elated or depressed and there’s no in-between. it’s not like a math contest which has the option of going “okay” (which actually happens the majority of the time).<br>
<br>
also for some reason I’m happier at school. maybe it’s because of osmosis, because the atmosphere at school is usually pretty upbeat <span style="color:#f0f">(as opposed to hearing the f-word in school every 10 seconds)</span> <span style="color:#f00">rip T_T</span>. and at home 90% of what my parents talk to me about is related to [x thing] or [y thing], neither of which I want to hear their opinions on. like… I’m old enough to make decisions myself, I swear. <span style="color:#f0f">(overprotectiveness and the like is rly killing our creativities; partially why we can't make probs -n)</span> <span style="color:#f00">true</span> so ig im looking forward to thanksgiving break (we have the entire next week off fsr) because of no hw and thus lots more free time, but also I really hope my happiness level won’t plummet during that time.<br>

			<div class="message">I kinda can't believe that tomorrow’s my last AMC<br>
after that there will be no more hype, nervousness, mornings spent frantically spamming discord and aops blogs, evenings spent spamming discord some more and metaphorically crying tears of joy or sadness<br>
it’s already kinda a dulled version of what it used to be now that I’m a senior; there’s so much less stress but also so much less excitement<br>
it’s kinda just a test for fun now, rather than something massive looming in the distance which will determine, to some extent, how confident I am for the rest of the year.<br>
it almost doesn’t feel like the AMC.<br>
anyway, after tomorrow, it’ll all be gone, tied up in a package representing childhood with 12 other AMC’s, that’ll fade away as time goes on<br>
I wonder if I’ll ever be that excitedly nervous for something again<br>
somehow I don’t get the same antsy feeling for olympiads, or AIME’s, because they’re so much longer so I can actually take my time and have a somewhat normal heart rate. but the AMC is literally a sprint, in which it helps to have a running start. there isn’t time to speed up once the clock has already begun ticking.<br>
<br>
hmm what else is happening<br>

<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>pumac power round is frying my brain cells</li>
<li>I’m literally not doing college stuff <strike>because I can’t bring myself to do things too far before their deadlines</strike> because im kinda sick of college stuff</li>
<li>I am also in a slight dilemma wrt school math club because my school has very very few stem nerds so running a math club is very very hard. I can either teach them actual math, in which case probably epsilon people would show up, or teach them “fake math” like riddles and puzzles and stuff which isn’t the actually interesting type of math but it might get more ppl to show up. but then when they try real stuff like the AMC, it will probably be a big surprise that maybe they wish math club had prepared them better for</li>
<li>it’s so sad seeing the kids at my middle school who are so interested in math now and knowing that in a few years peer pressure will have gotten to them and they’ll be jocks like (almost) every ex-nerd in my area</li>
</ul>
<br>
maybe nervousness does lead to excitement. maybe busyness does lead to happiness.</div>

			<div class="message">people say doing math helps you get into college<br>
but I know of tons of ppl who dedicated their whole childhoods to math and still didn’t get into the colleges they wanted<br>
so… does math really help you get into college??<br>
getting really good at it, even reaching mop or imo, just isn’t enough, because i've heard so many horror stories...<br>
these days I hear that it’s not math that matters, but other things like leadership and contribution to the community<br>
my parents rarely even talk about math anymore; only these things. they've changed, and I kinda can’t believe it. I wish they still talked about math. I used to think math was everything, but it really isn’t-- I guess that was just a myth I believed as a child.<br>
<br>
so many kids these days (including me) dedicate huge chunks of their childhoods to math, ending up with connections and the ability to think creatively, but <i>not</i> a free pass to college…<br>
nothing's free or can be taken for granted I guess<br>
<br>
please AO’s please please please please<br>
waiting is so painful, but I would rather wait forever than know…<br>
<br>
on the flip side, the one good thing about being a senior is that you don’t have to worry [as much] about the AMC<br>
I think I’m just going to wing it or smth ;-; still need to somehow not fail though<br>
<strike>math comps are like 60% luck 40% skill tbh</strike></div>

			<div class="message">I left BMT with almost the same feeling as last year, a combination of confusion and awe, but I guess in a different ratio<br>
I guess I don’t really care much about results anymore. I don’t really expect to do well anymore, because I rarely ever do well in college contests. so now I just expect nothing, and occasionally get a nice surprise<br>
but results aside, BMT just felt very <i>wholesome</i>, a feeling I don’t get from that many math contests.<br>
<br>
there’s something about meeting a ton of orz people and discovering that they are actually so kind and amazing irl<br>
there’s something about bonding with team members who you never really knew before but over the course of a day get to know them pretty well<br>
there’s something about walking/BARTing/riding in a car off into the clear SF night, realizing that what just happened was actually so immaculate<br>
and wondering if it will happen again<br>
with everyone around you as silhouettes, wondering whether or not they actually exist<br>
<br>
but now I’m sure they exist<br>
it’s come full circle. things were so different a year ago, but at the same time so similar<br>
this past year has been the first year in which my group of friends kinda didn’t change<br>
maybe it’s the beginning of normalcy<br>
maybe I’m done wandering the world and have found a place where I belong?<br>
but I haven’t, because sooner or later I won’t belong anymore…<br>
<br>
unfortunately all good things have to come to an end… but why so quickly?<br>
now I’m back in Pittsburgh, in figurative isolation, miles away, with only the Discord tab left as a portal, and with the countdown timer set back to 80+<br>
wondering if yesterday was all in a fantasy, or if it was only imaginary<br>
even if so, it was the most powerful type of daydream<br>
the type that can change your life</div>

totally not half trying to avoid the fact that college apps exist and doing math days before the deadline; my priorities are kinda messed up <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"> but ill finish it before the end of november 1st, <i>somehow</i><br>
<br>
I can’t help but think that although we had less [accomplishments] a few years ago, life was happier and more <i>meaningful</i>. we actually had stuff to work towards and motivation to go for them. what even is there to do now? I mean, there are things to do, but they’re not concrete. back then, I feel like I was actually accomplishing something. there was some sense of satisfaction from climbing the rungs, that I haven’t felt in a while.<br>
<br>
I’m not even doing math anymore to do well in competitions. I’m literally just doing it because if I don’t, I’ll lose brain cells. if you can't tell already, college apps destroy my brain cells. they're all about comparing people with each other.

			<div class="message">I’m so much different from a month ago and it’s so scary <span class="bbfont-half">I absolutely hate growing up</span><br>
<br>
why do ppl become less competitive as they grow up? back in middle school, almost everyone loved mini competitions and chances to win; now competitions are seen as cringe, and comparing ppl is seen as borderline toxic. everyone just wants life to be laid back and relaxing. our competitive spirits are fading, like how older ppl slowly lose the ability to sprint.<br>
<br>
maybe this is a reason why people lose interest in math as they grow up. there are kids in the middle school who just really like competitions in general, and math is smth they can do well at, so they try out math and then maybe end up liking it. winning is addictive, so they keep doing math competitions. but for us old ppl, it just isn’t that addictive anymore…<br>
<br>
because ppl tell us that other things matter more, like social connections. in america, life isn’t a game of winning, it’s a game of collaboration. rather than trying to beat other people, it’s about working together with them. the people who win aren’t even looked up to as much as people who have done impactful things. so winning really is kinda fake.<br>
<br>
I guess the one thing that you <i>do</i> get from winning is confidence. it’s a way of proving to yourself that you’re capable of accomplishing something. almost everyone I know who did math contests gained confidence because of it. and I guess if you’re able to solve a difficult math problem, there are so many other real-life problems you'll be able to solve, too.</div>

			<div class="message">like what am I even doing with my life<br>
this is the most lost ive been in the past 7 years<br>
so much more lost, in fact, than before mpfg, but thank god for that <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">reality check</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">yeah uh I did a bit underwhelmingly.. D:</div> :melting_face:<br>
there are way too many things to do and way too little time<br>
every so often I get bursts of motivation, to like be disciplined and productive and actually learn stuff like I did earlier in high school… and then those bursts of motivation eventually fade<br>
(these bursts of motivation somehow line up with going to a place other than school / home. somehow going outside and seeing the real world and seeing ppl I don’t usually see makes me re-think my life or smth)<br>
honestly probably a lot of the reason why I grinded earlier in high school was because so many ppl around me were doing it.. peer pressure rly does do wonders.. and also I didn’t have much else to do obviously<br>
<br>
recently my parents advised me to try as hard as possible to not lose motivation; not become burnt out / washed; not succumb to the forces of senioritis; not lose the capacity to work hard, even after my math competition journey might be coming to an end<br>
ever since I was really young they’d tell stories of rly smart ppl who just lost motivation when they got into college and then started wasting their lives<br>
and that was like the model of what not to be<br>
I rly rly don’t want to waste my life but it’s going to take as much going-against-the-status-quo as I can possibly muster-- even more than the decision to do math, or to not give up at any point along the way-- because senioritis, or lack of motivation, is something literally <i>everyone</i> experiences once they become a senior, or before that<br>
<br>
this is like the actual test; now there are actually very few outside forces pushing me along so i’ll have to push myself, something im not rly used to doing<br>
so this next year is going to be a brutal battle between me and senioritis<br>
ill have to actually swallow the meaning of a cinnamon roll<br>
and become one again<br>
while college apps threaten to crush what's left of my cinnamon roll-ness</div>

when I was a young child, my parents disciplined me and tried to make me have good manners, be smart, be not-materialistic, etc. and for a very long while I thought they were just doing this to make me disciplined; because with no pain comes no gain.<br>
<br>
but recently I realized there was another intention: they were trying to make a statement about themselves. a kid being polite is a sign that the parent is polite too, and same for smartness, and non-materialism. my parents simply cared a lot about these 3 things, so they naturally wanted to show it through how they raised me. the third thing, non-materialism, was the biggest struggle out of the three, because little kids are naturally materialistic. they’re naturally attracted to flashy and pretty things, and naturally have the urge to accumulate possessions. but this isn’t true of adults, at least much fewer of them. to adults, materialism is kind of a sign of childishness-- adults know that there are much more meaningful things in the world than material objects. to adults, having fewer material things is sometimes actually respected, and makes one happier; at least in my parents’ case. maybe maturing is letting go of materialism…<br>
<br>
so when my parents intentionally didn’t buy me the flashy toys and pretty objects that other kids had, they weren’t doing so to deprive me of anything, or really even discipline me. in fact, they were giving me more, because to them, less is more. they were simply making the choices that they would for themselves; the choices that would make themselves happier. and if I were to be an extension of them, surely it would make me happier too.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-one-five">3. I need to somehow escape my dad’s shadow</span><br>
<br>
this is one of the main reasons why I need to make a name for myself. it’s not because of fame or anything-- it’s because I don’t want to be in my dad’s shadow for my entire life. in order to poke out into the sunlight, even a tiny bit, I have to do something really important-- something that’s not a tiny dot compared to everything he’s done. I'm not just a little kid anymore, so I can't hide under my parents' roof. I need to go outside and do things of my own.<br>
<br>
if he gets really famous or something, which is already kinda happening, I’ll kinda be privileged without deserving any of it, and this I really dread. people will assume that I have a nice life all because of his work, even if I try my best not to accept any of the privileges. I’ll still be related to him. my dad is kinda fame-hungry and really really ambitious, and talks about running for president sometimes. I absolutely <b>do not</b> want him to run for president, (because if he does then I’ll be known to the public as the child of a politician instead of any of the things I’ve done), but I never say this.<br>
<br>
(I feel really bad for Biden’s children, or Elon Musk’s, or the children of any famous person, because it’s going to be so so hard for their reknown to be anything in comparison to their parents'… and so when people think of them, all they’ll think of is their connection to their parents.)<br>
<br>
I’m so selfish in thinking this way, honestly, which is why I never say any of this stuff out loud. I should let him live his own life and pursue his dreams, because everyone should have the right to. so I guess the only solution is to try as hard as I can to make a name for myself, and do something meaningful in the world, so that I won’t be completely eclipsed by someone else’s hard work forever.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-one-five">4. oly geo is kinda like a forest of wandering</span><br>
<br>
oly geo is so <i>connected</i> as a subject. every problem flows into another, like a forest of trees; everywhere you look, there are more trees nearby. add a few points or lines and it becomes an entirely different problem. there’s so much to explore in a problem and fiddle with the config-- you could wander forever. <span class="bbfont-three-q">and yet I still can't make a single problem</span><br>
<br>
this becomes especially apparent in teaching oly geo, because you literally just start with a triangle and add in some centers and suddenly some points are collinear, or concyclic, and boom, a fundamental lemma appears. add in some more points and lines, and more lemmas materialize. in order to teach oly geo, you just have to take a walk down a trail. naturally, cool-looking nature will catch your eye, perhaps similar to stuff you've seen before, and you will point them out to your students.<br>
<br>
this is why I got addicted during covid-- because it’s literally a journey of discoveries, like narnia. visit once, and you’ll want to go back again and again, to discover more. it's limitless-- there’s always something new to find that you didn’t know the previous day. there's always another property of a point or config that you didn't know before. and of course, geo is visual, and so are forests. you can sometimes sense things that might be true in geo diagrams, or objects to add that have nice properties, like how you can kinda see shadows of trees in the distance, if you look carefully.<br>
<br>
the other subjects may be forests too, just not in the same way as geo. I wouldn’t really know though, because I’m only at the very entrance.</div>

			<div class="message">Hi<br>
No one here knows me<br>
Just trying to keep blog alive<br>
V u can delete if necessary<br>
<br>
Just a bunch of random stuff:<br>
Got addicted to https://www.youtube.com/@CNmusic246<br>
Made PuMac Team<br>
Was not able to AK Inequalities Standard...as i used all hints and morally i dont submit the ones that i use all hints on<br>
Computational has been on downhill<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________________________<br>
Also I needa ask for some advice<br>
I have a friend, an indian. He is being micromanaged on an extremely high degree by his parents: they give him IIT problems and expect him to solve in 15 min (I could barely do that). They consistently call him "beta" and "if you dont do well we will pull you back to india." The parents expect him to get IChO, IPhO, IMO, and Chess GM by the 2nd term in senior year which is basically impossible. Acting as a friend, I have told a prefect. But then he came over and said if this gets reported his parents will pull him back to india.<br>
<br>
This is just dum and morally wrong. Hoewver, for the sake of not getting him pulled back to india, I can't say anything and so can't his other friends. We feel useless...and since hes been having 988 thoughts overall the mood of the dorm has gone down.<br>
What should we as friends do? I know that his parents insist on keeping him on a zoom call from 9 am - 11 pm (breaks allowed for food, thats it) during weekends, during week days 3pm-11pm. He is not allowed to attend any fun events or dorm meetings (his parents sent the dean an email "excusing" him from those).<br>
<br>
Please help,<br>
Me, and 4 friends</div>

			<div class="message">time is precious and scarce now, and everyone (mainly referring to my grade at school, but also everyone in general) has decided on their ideal way of spending it-- because we humans love consistency-- and anything other than this is, to them, kind of a waste. and everyone’s agenda is so different. we’re so much more different from each other than when we were little kids. kids are somewhat similar, but adults are so different.<br>
<br>
time is so important that we’re constantly checking it on our phones, watches, computers, etc. we count down the minutes left of class; the down days left of school. mandatory meetings are made as short as possible, to get to the point and conserve time. <i>”don’t ask questions, so that we can get out of here as soon as possible”</i>, someone whispered at a grade-level meeting the other day. the conversation-ending phrase “don’t want to take too much of your time” gets thrown around countless times every day, as if time cannot be taken from someone without their permission… almost like money. time <i>is</i> money.<br>
<br>
what if we could just lose track of it again? time is so distracting sometimes, but losing track of it is so much harder than it was before. back in elem/middle school, we’d arrive and then before we knew it, it would be lunchtime. life felt like a blissful rollercoaster back then without any perception of time. we actually enjoyed spending time with people other than our best friends, and doing stuff not on our agendas. back then, speaking up and talking extra was cool; nowadays, saying the bare minimum is more socially accepted because it saves time. nowadays, it feels like many hours have passed, but it’s only 9 AM.<br>
<br>
I wish I could lose track of time during school again, like before. honestly, that would make classes so much more fun-- I could focus way more and actually immerse myself in them. maybe I would absorb much more. but it’s so hard to forget time without daydreaming and losing track of what’s going on. nowadays, losing track of time only happens naturally when having fun… and only then can hours fly by like entire days did when we were kids. this is what people save up their time for: their favorite things. there’s no time to randomly wander through life and interact with strangers anymore. everyone knows exactly how they want to allocate their time to maximize their efficiency and happiness. time is constantly on everyone’s minds…<br>
<br>
and the more you think about it, the worse you get at forgetting it. <span style="color:#f0f"><span class="bbfont-half">i lost the game</span></span></div>

			<div class="message">a year ago, if asked, I would’ve said that I was religious. even a few months ago. but somehow now my view on religion has changed-- probably a result of hearing a lot of others’ peoples thoughts on it. and now I don’t know if I’m religious anymore.<br>
<br>
I grew up in a religious (catholic) family, because my dad’s family is religious and my parents basically tried to copy a lot of things my dad’s parents did, including religion. we went to church every sunday and said prayers every night and my siblings and I went to catholic school for 1 hour a week. my family wasn’t <i>super</i> religious, like obviously we believed in evolution and science and not the religious view of creation, but my parents always thought of religion as a way of strengthening morality-- even if they weren’t true, the stories in the Bible taught moral lessons that could be applied to real life to make one a better person. those stories were always about forgiving sinners if they were truly sorry, no matter what they did, or about being harassed and forgiving the people who harassed you instead of fighting back, or about giving things up for others. Jesus seemed like the model human being, and the fact that he “loved all of us” was just kinda comforting. the idea that there was always someone <i>up in the sky</i> to rant to when we felt sad, or mad at someone else, was just really nice. so religion to us really was just a source of motivation to keep being a good person.<br>
<br>
as a kid, often when I was mad at my parents, or anyone else, I prayed to Jesus and magically the anger would fade away. <i>Jesus would forgive them</i>, I thought. in 8th grade, I was like really really religious, and prayed every night out of my own will, without anyone forcing me to. <strike>I also prayed for kinda absurd things such as to grow taller.</strike> I never prayed for anything that I deemed <i>selfish</i> though, such as getting a good score on a test or something, because I thought Jesus had the morality to not grant such wishes to only certain people. I became religious to the point that if I needed to do something which I didn’t really want to do, I would promise to Jesus that I would do it, and then I would actually end up doing it.<br>
<br>
and then after a while, around the beginning of high school, this feeling of absolute trust faded. I began to question how well this method of praying for stuff and having them actually happen actually worked. it began to seem kinda childish and futile. also, I slowly realized that almost everyone else I interacted with in the math community had a very different view of religion. no one else thought of it as a wholesome way of life like I did. it seemed to be thought of as a fake method of coping that helps one falsely make sense of the world. like the opposite of science, like believing in it means you don’t believe in evolution or something, which means you are kinda dumb and antiquated. so gradually (but mostly in the past year) I began to be less and less religious.<br>
<br>
because I know everything I said above about religion helping one be moral is completely possible to achieve without being religious. it’s just called having ethics. and there are plenty of perfectly ethical people who are not religious at all.<br>
<br>
also, my parents have gotten a lot busier over time. we haven’t said prayers every night for a while, and often certain members of my family are too busy to go to church. so naturally we have gotten less religious.<br>
<br>
this fall, arml practice moved so that it conflicts with the church service we usually go to, and that might have been the final straw. that was the most convenient church service to go to, and going to a different one means my busy parents would have to shift around their schedules, which might be just slightly too much of a hassle given the diminished meaning that religion has to us in the present day. and so I might never really be religious again... from now on, it might be just a part of my childhood that’s borne back ceaselessly into the past.<br>
<br>
edit: ok ive decided to continue being <i>somewhat religious</i>, as some ppl have put it</div>

			<div class="message">i'm a very particular person when it comes to the order i do things in when given a large problem set.<br>
<br>
on an amc, i run through the whole test first, for each problem trying the first idea that i think might work, and if it doesn't work, i move on, and rate approximately how approachable i think the problem is, until i reach the end and then i go back to the remaining problems, not in the order of the test, but in the order of whichever remaining problem i think is the most approachable (of course this changes over time), and keep doing this until the end.<br>
<br>
when i am doing an otis unit, i try the problems for maybe five minutes each at the start, and come back (for much longer) to the ones that seem interesting or i feel like i am on the right track or close to solving. again, this is far from the order of the problems in the unit, or club value, or anything.<br>
<br>
this is funnily enough also why i get a lot of ak's, because by the time i have solved all of the required problems i am already almost done or already done with the unit, so at that point i just usually finish it.<br>
<br>
and, now when it comes to contest collections (e.g. IMO), i have this very bad habit of doing all of the p1's (or p4's) first, rather than go by order of year or whatever. i did every modern imo 1/4. now i don't have any imo mocks i can do accurately since i have seen at least one problem on all of them. sure, there are evan's shortlist mocks, but those were non-selected problems, and even then, because again of this incredibly bad habit, i have done most of the isl 1s and 2s, so most of those have at least one problem that i have already seen as well.<br>
<br>
same goes for apmo, by this point i have done almost all apmo 1s, about half of the 2s, and a few 3-5s. again, because of all the p1s that i did, there are only a few years where i have not seen the problems yet, so i also do not have that many i can do for apmo either, hence i am trying to save them.<br>
<br>
in addition to depriving yourself of accurate mocks, another bad thing about doing all of the p1s is that, to better improve, you need to expose yourself to more difficult problems. doing all of the p1s runs entirely contrary to this, since you are doing for the most part easier problems, which should not be the case. you also need to not be intimidated by higher-numbered problems, and purposely squeezing out p1s is like escaping from them. this definitely doesn't help you confront those more difficult problems when you need to on a test.<br>
<br>
so, don't just do every p1/p4 from some contest as your first thing like i did, you will get the much-needed exposure to difficult problems, even if you need hints you can still learn a lot from them, and maybe leave yourself some accurate mocks.<br>
<br>
i'm trying to follow this myself and i think it has been working, i have attempted quite a few harder problems (30+) and even when i had to take hints i felt like they were very instructive.<br>

			<div class="message">math is kinda therapeutic. keeps me sane. sleeping 8 hours is actually fun, and makes me able to pay more attention in class. maybe dotted was right about that. but I usually get &lt;7. <strike>hmm reaper actually does make me more productive; more motivation to wake up early.</strike> aops spammer podcast interesting idea. I think I signed myself up for too many things to do because I fundamentally don’t have enough time (oops currently npc'ing on ghana stuff oops oops). time to actually get priorities or smth.<br>
I dont have brain capacity to write high quality posts anymore because I actually <i>have to</i> write things other than blog posts &gt;_&lt;<br>
oops I have to write an english paper (HELPPPP WRITING TAKES SO MUCH TIME) and chem lab report and do some athemath logistics stuff in the next like day cuz im going to be out of town on like thursday and friday x_x oh yea and possibly also hmmt registration stuff cuz that’s due on saturday or smth. literally just not enough time to do everything <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
also my younger brother is 2 of the same classes as me (chem and cs) and he’s much better than me at both LOL<br>
also ive still made like 0 progress on college stuff yayyy!<br>
because im too lazy to actually think of activities, I just play ted ed riddles and 3b1b videos for the kids in math club..<br>
<br>
ok but math is kind of the cure to all this insanity tho. getting off discord and listening to music (totally productive) and doing math is actually so relaxing sometimes.<br>
very good grammar in this post.<br>
<br>
random thought: <strike>maybe the reason why im unable to write problems is because my brain is wired so that I want to length chase everything and not actually think</strike><br>
other random thought: doing things alone is sometimes much more efficient than like working with other people</div>

			<div class="message">I'm kinda losing my grip on life<br>
<br>
idrk what im doing anymore, but I'm slipping-- I'm not as good at math as I used to be, I probably don’t have as many friends as I used to<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">,</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">like... back in ms I had so many more friends, just like random ppl I'd met on AoPS and played FTW with and barely knew anything about their identity. so many of them. somehow life just isn't that simple anymore.</div> I'm supposed to be a leader or smth but I don’t really know how to lead, and also I'm about to fall off the block that is high school and into some college. I'm clinging onto this block but am gradually slipping, and I can only hold on for 9 months more…<br>
<br>
I used to have better time management, and didn’t waste hours on social media (especially second-tier social media smh). I used to have a much better work ethic and not procrastinate on things for so long. I used to have such a pure mindset of <i>just do math!</i> and didn’t have to worry about other things<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">kinda like what advaith was saying on his blog</div> life just isn’t that pure anymore, and will probably never again be :/<br>
<br>
college apps are quite depressing. so many of my senior friends are like half depressed, or at least they seem like so. life isn’t happy like it used to be, because of this heavy cloud hovering over us, forcing us to compare ourselves with other ppl (like ppl in the math community don’t already do enough of that), and write essays even though we have no idea how to. i'll be sad if I don’t get into X college, but I'll be even more sad if any of my friends don’t, because they deserve it JUST AS MUCH as me.<br>
<br>
speaking of friends, sustaining friendships takes effort, and maybe I should put in more of this effort. I kinda wish I had more close friends, but all the seniors are so busy with college apps that they have barely any free time. (oops, not me having barely started my college apps.) somehow it’s just a lot harder to make friends in general than it was in middle school, cuz there are so fewer people similar to you…<br>
<br>
it feels like I have 0 free time, but if I spent less time on social media, (especially second-tier social media), then I would have much more. actually I have a lot of free time, because there are 24 hours in the day and I don’t spend that many of them being productive. the more things I have to do, the less time I would get to waste… so maybe I should just find more things to do or smth.<br>
<br>
I'm pretending to be sane these days because I really wish I was, but I'll kinda be losing my mind for the next ~187 days<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">praying that all my friends and I get into X college :pleading_face: :pleading_face:</div> hopefully this feeling of lost-ness will eventually fade away. hopefully I'll find my place in the world again, even if it isn’t doing oly math. but for now, I honestly have no idea what I’m doing; trying to get from one island to the next without drowning in the middle.<br>
<br>
edit: ok this was kinda pessimistic oopsss.. there are a lot of good things happening in my life too!!</div>

			<div class="message">this post might be incomprehensible because my brain is not working, and also it will NOT have proper English like my previous one did (because writing in full sentences is actually so cringe)<br>
<br>
anyway ive been like insanely busy recently mostly because of athemath logistical work (mostly scheduling stuff; should be done in a few days) and like hw and other things at school, which include running some clubs and helping with the ms mathcounts team <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> thankfully my school classes aren't a very big workload yet tho.<br>
<br>
athemath work is very time-consuming cuz there are like 2x as many ppl as before but it's also very exciting and inspiring because so many little kiddos who are <i>motivated</i> and have all that positive kid energy. and also I get to put forth my own vision for what I want it to look like (ofc with other ppls' input too) which is just amazing, like there's so much freedom, but also I better not mess up because this is a decently sized project. so yeah I am very very happy to be running athemath, although I did take over when it was already like really well-established so im not like one of the OG founders or anything, and I kinda got lucky in that it already had so much potential!<br>
<br>
so yeah ive basically been pouring time into athemath (hopefully it will take up slightly less time in like a week or two) and hence spending less time on everything else, like math (oops ive done barely any math in the past few days T_T), college apps (oops my college app progress has basically been halted), and also second-tier social media sites (like the aops blogroll oops). nowadays I naturally wake up at 4 and can't go back to sleep so I usually get 6 hours of sleep, but I swear there need to be 48 hours in the day!! but anyway aside from being slightly sad/worried about not being able to do as much math, im very excited about how life is going <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">In a school classroom setting... usually answering questions when you know the answer, or are 80% sure of the answer, seems like a good idea, and answering questions is 100% more interesting than sitting there doing nothing. But then there’s the issue of being seen as a know-it-all, and so often in math class these days I mostly just keep silent. I’m already kind of thought of as a math know-it-all (because very very few people do math competitions) and this is probably kinda a bad thing given my classmates’ general negative attitude towards math. The vast majority of people at my school (and probably also in general) have a negative impression of know-it-alls, especially math and science ones, because I guess the fact that they exist makes it slightly harder for the teacher to teach the class at a pace suitable for the average student. Being in a room with a know-it-all would also be slightly discomforting for the average student because they might become more self conscious of their own ability, and this might distract them from learning the material. And so maybe my classmates' perception of me has made me rather distant. Maybe if I had pretended to be one of them all this time, I'd be closer to them.<br>
<br>
A fellow Daily Challenge teacher said something very interesting recently: <i>that sometimes it’s actually beneficial to appear dumber than you are.</i> When you’re with someone who’s much better than you at something, sometimes it’s good to just let them have their moment; especially if they really enjoy teaching other ppl; to just let yourself be taught. And in the opposite situation, if expressing your level of knowledge might figuratively separate you from everyone else and result in them thinking of you as an <i>other</i>, then maybe for the sake of friendliness it might be good to just temporarily pretend to be one of them.<br>
<br>
This is completely the opposite of what goes on in the math community; in the math community, people often pretend to be greater than they are instead of less than. Achievements are often flaunted, instead of kept hidden. Which dynamic creates stronger friendships-- the one in which people often think of each other as a set of achievements, or the one in which everything <i>but</i> that matters? I know of some math competition kids who have formed really strong friendships with school friends which have nothing to do with math. Maybe these friendships really <i>are</i> more genuine-- where people value each other for the true people they are, and no one even wants to hear how well you did on something because it won’t change their perception of you.</div>

<br>
The first day of school lasted three hours since the power died. Classes were shortened from 25 minutes to 15 minutes since the cafeteria couldn't function. Basically nothing interesting happened other than the bio teacher mentioning a test in two days and talking about how he gave a pop quiz during a test once.<br>
<br>
Day 2:<br>
<br>
First half of the day is singing and then after that the next teacher forgot to show up so we got a study hall. Lunch actually happened today! In English we did an activity where we basically just pretended to be random characters that the teacher assigned. Then, I have study hall, then I went home.<br>

			<div class="message">wow, things are so different now<br>
<br>
the first thing I noticed was a really strange feeling of emptiness/loneliness, which I eventually realized was the absence of the class of 2023. although I was never <i>really good</i> friends with any of them, I’ve been in lots of classes with them throughout high school, especially math, science, and Chinese. last year, I even interacted with some of them more than people in my own grade. and so, without exactly realizing it, I accidentally built up acquaintanceships with some of them, and now it’s such a shock to see them gone. I didn’t even really say a proper goodbye because I didn’t really consider them to be that close friends last year, but now I regret that.<br>
having older people in the school is also an excuse to not quite be a role model, because there are still older people to look up to. but now that there are no grades above, I’m forced to be a role model, which is going to take a while to adjust to..<br>
<br>
I’m really going to miss math class from last year (ok this was mainly just the teacher being AMAZING not so much the class content being amazing xDDD) and physics class from last year (this was both the teacher being great and the content being interesting)-- actually I think I just pretty much took all the best classes last year, so it’s almost impossible for this year’s to match those in terms of enjoyability-- but I think chem and cs this year will be interesting. I switched from ap bio to ap chem because 1) chem gives a lot less work at my school, 2) seems more interesting, and 3) teacher is a LOT better. so I’ll be in the same class as my younger brother who is also taking ap chem and is wayyy better at chem than I am lol.. honestly idc tho xD<br>
all that summer bio work for nothing xDDD but it’s ok<br>
<br>
I also decided not to go to september atlas because missing 6 days of school would just be reallyyyy rough.. so much work to make up, so many teachers to bother, not being able to carry out my duties in the clubs that I’m running this year… I think it just wouldn’t be worth it.<br>
I also finally drafted one of my college essays yesterday<br>
<br>
I guess I’ll eventually get over my slight longing for junior year, and although I’m not as good of a role model as the class of 2023 was, I’ll try…</div>

			<div class="message">1) I actually can’t function without deadlines<br>
<br>
it’s actually so bad, like I’m so used to doing math comps with time limits or smth that I can’t really get stuff done without time limits<br>
I procrastinated on my ~12 hours of summer bio homework until the last like 2 days before school LOL somehow it was just so hard to find motivation to do it before this weekend… and now I’m just going full grind mode because of the extreme amount of time pressure. this is how it’s been with everything, since like… Zoom school when I literally did homework for xth period class in x-1th period<br>
even doing math problems in my free time is hard because there’s no deadline. there’s no time by which I need to have solved the problem. <strike>surfing HSO is different because I feel like im actually contributing to smth by posting a solution which gives me some sort of weird motivation.</strike> I somehow managed to grind OTIS in 10th grade by setting deadlines for myself, like I kinda told myself to finish x unit in x amount of days. and I guess part of my motivation to do as many units as possible was that OTIS costed money and so I needed to get the most out of it as possible. and the other part of it was that I wanted to prove my competence.<br>
but somehow now I can’t bring myself to conjure up deadlines like that anymore..?<br>
I don’t even know how people do things without deadlines<br>
maybe I need to learn how to do things as soon as possible instead of as late as possible again<br>
<br>
oh the only reason why I was able to actually grind bio today was because I got off discord for the whole afternoon. I swear, discord is like a void-- when I go in, I don’t come out<br>
<br>
<br>
2) another difficult time management question is when to give up on a math problem. or when to quit the current approach and look for another one. I used to really, really not want to give up on geometry problems because to not solve them would ruin my ego. some memorable examples of this were 2023 ARML Indiv #8 and 2022 TSTST #6; I spent almost all the time I had on these problems and that was such a bad mistake. first of all, I should not think that I’ll be able to solve all the geo problems I encounter because that is absolutely not true. (so like on this year’s TSTST #6 I kinda just accepted that I probably wasn’t going to solve the problem and that made me feel so much better than had I insisted I was going to solve it.)<br>
<br>
but 2022 TSTST #6 was a horrible, horrible story-- probably the worst contest day experience I’ve had-- because I basically told myself that I had to solve the problem and then spent the entire 4 hours and 30 minutes, maybe minus a couple minutes, burying my soul into that problem and didn’t even let myself go to the bathroom because I thought every minute was so important (stupidest decision ever) and then I left the contest not quite solving the problem and I was literally so sad (esp when #4 was the easiest problem on the whole TSTST and I completely missed my chance to solve it LOL)<br>
<br>
so yea don’t make this mistake lol. even worse stuff happened on that day, partially unrelated to this, that I think I talked about sometime in the past. but I really need to not “bury my soul” into problems, or at least strike some sort of balance between wholeheartedly trying the problem as hard as I can and also leaving room to try different problems or different approaches.<br>
<br>
but yeah giving up is really challenging. it can be really hard to give up on one solution idea when you’ve already made some progress in that direction, like switching from local to global in a combo problem or in the case of 2023 TSTST #4, switching from constructing equality cases to summing stuff.<br>
<br>
kinda like how switching off of a life path you got pretty far on is hard. familiarity is so comfortable, but sometimes the adventure is worth it.</div>

			<div class="message">my parents are actually treating me like a teenager now, which is really weird<br>
in the past few months they have given me much more freedom: letting me listen to music (and not saying it’s distracting), even playing music themselves, letting me call my friends on discord and not asking a billion questions about it afterwards, letting me spend a LOT of time on discord a day, even in the mornings which was previously designated “math time”, letting me go anywhere outside that I want...<br>
I kinda understand why they enforced restrictions before, because my siblings and I were young and impressionable and my parents wanted us to learn good habits while we were young so that we would hopefully keep those good habits<br>
but recently my brother has been publicly acting more like a teenager (basically breaking every “house rule” there was, by listening to music, talking to friends and spending tons of time online, visiting friends’ houses, and he even tried using phone at meals..) and he does not hesitate to question why rules are the way they are so when he starts breaking rules, my parents have a really hard time enforcing them again, and so the rules kinda just shatter. sometimes I wish I had more of his rebelliousness.<br>
<br>
so now my parents kinda just let me do my own thing and don’t really question it. they know I’m on discord a lot but don’t ask exactly who I’m talking to, like they used to. they never seem to demand too precise answers anymore. they’re much less involved in my life than before, and I don’t think I’ll ever again be as close to them as I was before…<br>
<br>
I have a lot more freedom now, and objectively a lot more things to be happy about, but still somehow I was still happier as a child. (I’m still pretty happy now, I was just even more happy then.) I was unsure of so many more things, such as whether or not I would qualify for various things, and I got punished a lot more, but somehow I was still overall happier. I guess my standards of happiness were much lower back then, like listening to music would make me really really happy, and then over time I got used to more and more good things being just “normal” that they didn’t trigger as much dopamine anymore.<br>
<br>
I don’t get how I could have been that happy with so much uncertainty before… right now I’m more scared than excited for senior year because of the chance that I’ll end up separated from my friends at college. I don’t care which college; I just don’t want to be separated, because I feel like it’ll be much harder to interact at different colleges. do people still interact with their high school friends who are at different colleges, or do they kinda just stay in the bubble of their own college and try to make new friends? I feel like it’s mostly the latter… anyway I might be clinging on to high school way too hard, but I feel like my fate is basically in the hands of some college ao’s right now.<br>
<br>
maybe my parents enforcing the restrictions that they did when I was a child was actually a net positive, because it taught me to be happier with less. maybe I need to lower my standards of happiness again to appreciate smaller things again, because if my standards keep rising, it’ll be kinda hard to stay sufficiently happy.</div>

			<div class="message">you might think that I’m so involved in the math community, but really, I just want to be remembered.<br>
you might think that I’m so sociable, always talking to ppl on Discord, but really, I just want to be remembered.<br>
even in 2017 when I played Flash FTW for hours a day… that was because I wanted to be remembered. of course I really enjoyed the math, but being <i>really</i> active and talking a lot and trying really hard to make friends was a way to be remembered by other people. it was a chance to be a little less of a nobody.<br>
I started this blog because I wanted to be remembered.<br>
I tried hard with math because I wanted to be relevant, and not just some random person nobody knew about.<br>
I still spam AoPS HSO even as a rising senior partly because I have little else to do and really enjoy doing <span class="bbfont-three-q">(certain types of)</span> math, but partly because I want to be remembered by random people on AoPS.<br>
I’ve always done weird and unique stuff and never quite fit in anywhere, but that was just because I wanted to be remembered.<br>
I try to help younger kids in the math community, which is a win-win situation because they feel like they’re getting helped, but so am I, because my degree is increasing in the graph of connections. I guess I’ve always had a really strong desire to make this degree as large as possible.<br>
<br>
so yeah, I’m unfortunately not by any means a selfless human being who does good for the world solely because it helps people, and does math solely to challenge myself and become better. everything I do, although it may be for some objectively good cause, is partly motivated by of the personal incentive to get closer to my life goal* of being remembered (hopefully as a good person, of course).<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">* a few days ago, crazyeyemoody907 said that their life goals were to “be remembered, and make memories”, and I realized that that was very true for me as well. what else is there in life to actually aim for?</span></div>

			<div class="message">is how money works<br>
why can’t I give my friend some random 50 dollars I got, if they need it way more than me? why can’t I give someone a plane ticket to a math competition that their parents won’t pay for but mine will? I get various amounts of money from random sources (Athemath, math competitions, etc), which are unintentional by the way because money is definitely not the reason why I do them, and I don’t even know where the money goes, but I don’t use it-- because I have literally nothing to pay for, and my parents taught me to save money. I know that many kids, including some of my friends, actually need that money… so why can’t I give it to them? it’s such a small amount of money, if you think about it-- the amount of money I get per year is only a 3 digit number or maybe a small 4 digit number, and compared to a salary or college tuition it’s nothing. but for these kids, it would help them so much-- to be able to attend an in-person math competition, for example.<br>
yet somehow the transfer of money is labeled as very taboo, and I’ve always been dissuaded from giving money to people, even like 50 dollars.<br>
I guess the fact that some people get money despite not needing it, and others vice versa, is one of the most basic problems in the world…<br>
but what am I supposed to do with money in the future if I don’t give it to people? keep it for myself? I guess I could, but that seems rather selfish… or I could try and make exactly the amount of money I need, but that might be difficult too…<br>
<br>
oh yeah I didn’t understand a lot of other basic concepts as a child, like for example I didn’t understand why during the Holocaust the Jewish people didn’t just pretend to be Christian and avoid getting killed… I was pretty dumb…</div>

			<div class="message">I have a serious attention span issue.. I can't pay attention to long classes or lectures<br>
I think it's because I'm used to daydreaming instead of paying attention in school (but pretending that I am)<br>
honestly daydreaming is sometimes more interesting than actually paying attention in school tho<br>
in classes which were completely lecture style (for ex: english class last year) I could just daydream the entire time which was pretty fun<br>
so at the camps I went to this summer, even if a class or lecture was interesting, every so often I would just stop paying attention and start thinking about random stuff and then I miss a part of the lecture which makes it harder to follow along :/<br>
and like the only way to pay attention the whole time is if I ask lots of questions or smth lol<br>
hmm maybe if I did more nongeo, I could think about problems in my head which would be more productive than just randomly daydreaming.. but unfortunately this is not the case..<br>
I'm clearly not an auditory learner :/<br>
<br>
wait oops is this why ppl take notes, to keep from daydreaming?<br>
<br>
I should rly stop procrastinating on certain 0 mohs things I have to do which will literally take an hour max if I actually do them but I'm just not :////<br>
<br>
I'm kinda looking forward to school starting so that 1) I will have more things to occupy myself and thus be more productive in the free time that I have (rn im just pretty unproductive because I have soooo much free time and it's kinda hard to be productive for that many hours of the day D:), 2) more interesting because more ppl to talk to and/or observe.. idk after being at camps I just want to be around other ppl again, 3) so that I can practice (not) daydreaming in class</div>

			<div class="message">oops have not been posting lately because G2 is kinda busy or smth<br>
well actually its not but for some reason going to G2 makes me not want to post on blog as much<br>
while SPARC does the opposite<br>
I guess G2 and SPARC are just complete opposites in general<br>
I also accidentally deleted my list of possible blog post topics that I've kept for like many months lol so rip those ideas (not like they were that good tho xD)<br>
G2 is very interesting and fun, but I do find it a little harder to be connected to the community due to being older than most of the students lol<br>
however, the little kids HAVE made me want to do math more : D<br>
I've been procrastinating on everything I don't want to do (doing SAT practice tests, AP Bio summer work, and other random things I have to do) until after G2, so when I get home tomorrow I will be having a lot of fun :skull:<br>
one thing is for sure though: going to G2 makes me really, really, not want to do, or think about, college apps<br>
and apparently I need to get a draft of an essay due by 8/27 :skull: rip lol<br>
<br>
today is the last day of G2, and tonight is the "all-nighter" the highlight of which is painting the CMU fence from midnight to whenever we finish which should be rly fun : D<br>
I don't think I'll be able to pull a full all nighter though because I have some important meeting at 1pm ish so I'll probably sleep at some early hour of the morning idk<br>
<br>
ok that was not a very deep post lol, maybe when I get back home I'll suddenly have a flood of thoughts and will think of stuff then</div>

I’ve kinda gotten used to fitting in with younger people and pretending to be one of them. and I’ve noticed that young people tend to be optimistic, driven, and naive, which I find pretty inspiring, but as a result I’m naive as well.<br>
<br>
being at G2 makes me feel young again, although I’m not. it’s weird seeing so many of my athemath students as <i>high schoolers</i>, living their best lives at the camp of their dreams, and I’m so, so happy for them. it’s weird being one of the 4 rising seniors and not quite old enough to be a TA but a little too old to fit in properly as a student. it’s weird having all the younger kids expect you to know how to do math problems when you’re.. not as smart as they all imagine you to be. it’s weird having everyone ask if you’ve started college apps yet when all you want is to keep doing math. it’s weird being too much of a cinnamon roll to be retired but too close to being retired to be a proper cinnamon roll…<br>
<br>
I’ll try, I guess. for now, I’ll keep wasting time on the AoPS blogroll to catch my last glimpses of what middle and high school life was like-- never mind how chaotic and spammy it was--, keep running Athemath so I can still interact with and help the younger generation who will be dominating the oly community in a couple of years, and cling onto my connections to the math community as long as I can.</div>

			<div class="message">how do people actually <i>do</i> things<br>
<i>do</i> things as in run startups, actually discover new things through research, create new things rather than just copying something someone else did..<br>
this seems infinitely harder than solving a math problem, because the solution to that math problem is already written down somewhere, unlike in the above list of things, and so you’re not actually creating anything new by solving it<br>
<br>
the people who have <i>created new things</i> seem to me kinda superhuman<br>
at SPARC they brought several such people here to give guest talks and I just cannot comprehend the existence of these people. they’re 20-30 year olds who have done research since they were 12 and discovered something groundbreaking, or dropped out of high school / college to found a business, or done something else crazy. they’re built of something different, I swear. the fact that I’ve never heard of any of them, yet they are so famous, makes them ever more awe-inspiring, and further convinces me that I really have no idea what I’m doing with my life.<br>
<br>
if STEM competitions are like mountains, and getting an IMO gold medal is like reaching the top, then these people I’m talking about are like birds, existing way up high and equipped with the superhuman power of flight. going to SPARC is like taking a 10-day-long airplane flight during which we are surrounded by birds we’ve never seen before and never even knew existed. and we all leave with the desire to learn to fly someday, but how? sure we may have climbed some distance up the mountain, but getting off the ground is still a near-impossible task..</div>

			<div class="message">this post is partly dedicated to a certain gc which has actually been a pretty big part of my life for the past year, and is now gone<br>
esp in summer and fall 2022, I actually spent quite a while in this gc, mostly doing math problems but also talking about life a little bit, and I actually grew quite close to the ppl in this gc for a little while, and made some lasting connections…<br>
…and then stuff happened and we became less close and eventually the gc kinda fell apart.<br>
I guess life changes, and that gc served its purpose for a certain period of my life, and now we’re moving on<br>
it’s kinda sad how things change<br>
but that’s just how life is<br>
<br>
also I’ve realized that I’ve never really known <i>how</i> to be a good friend. I think I interact with a lot of different people, and we might think of each other as acquaintances or semi-friends or friends depending on your definition, but I have very very few people who are on the level of <i>best</i> friend. since I was young, I’ve never really had a few “besties” like everyone else has. I think it might be because I’m quite bad at taking initiative and actually trying to interact more with the people I like to think I’m close with, and just kinda let them do it first. so I think the fact that I have very few close friends is mostly my fault. maybe I need to learn how to actually be a good friend.<br>
<br>
also, I think I have a pretty big ego and sometimes continue to disagree with people not because I inherently disagree, but because I don’t want the fact that I have “lost” the argument to damage my ego. I think this has mostly only happened during arguments with my parents a few years ago but I really need to stop doing it.<br>
<br>
I miss doing math. in order to have time to do math at SPARC, I’d either have to participate in less SPARC activities or interact less with my non-SPARC friends, both of which would come at a cost, and so I’m just like, not doing math at SPARC. I’m really scared of my math skill deteriorating after 10 days of not doing it; I really want to check that it’s still there.</div>

			<div class="message">I want to stop being viewed as “elite”<br>
I just want to be a random math-loving kid again<br>
who happily does math in peace with an actual work ethic and maybe few accomplishments, but a million dreams…<br>
the reference is to two residential places in the The Great Gatsby, East Egg being for the “well-established” people and West Egg being for those who are still establishing themselves and still figuring things out. and SPARC is a so-called East Egg camp, for people who have good-looking achievements on paper but inside have stopped grinding and are reaping the rewards of these accomplishments and enjoying the luxurious life…<br>
I hate the luxurious life. the freedom, the opportunities, the fact that there are so many overwhelmingly generous people to help you; something one wouldn’t even find at MOP. I don’t want to be thought of as a “SPARC-ler”, or a “East Egg”-er, although I absolutely am so guilty of both. I wish I still had hills to climb and shining lights to chase -- well maybe I still do, but I have yet to find them. and the worst part of it is that I don’t feel worthy of whatever achievements I’ve been sitting on; I think I’ve tried way less than lots of other people and gotten way more. I don’t understand why I’ve been presented with so many opportunities despite being inherently no better than anyone else. it actually makes me so, so sad sometimes.<br>
I miss the days when I had a work ethic -- <span class="bbfont-three-q"><i>oh my god you should actually get a work ethic again that’s literally the first step towards becoming a West Egger again what are you even doing</i></span> -- and I absolutely admire every cinnamon roll I meet. (btw “cinnamon roll” refers to younger math kids who are working hard towards their dreams, which I actually find it really inspiring).<br>
if only I could be like you..<br>
so please don’t look up to me as a “SPARC-ler”, or an accomplished mathlete of any kind. I just want to be someone who loves math, like the rest of us. I just want to be your friend.</div>

			<div class="message">ok why is doing nongeo so hard I swear I need like 10x more brainpower and 10x more focus to do nongeo<br>
like I literally have to be in a test setting or smth<br>
this is why I sometimes enjoy nongeo problems in-test, because I'm like forced to actually think about the problem, but in practice I can never be focused enough to enjoy them.. meanwhile I can enjoy geo problems anytime, even if I'm talking on discord simultaneously<br>
every few months I debate whether I should seriously try to get better at nongeo, and every time I give up because it's too difficult... T_T<br>
<br>
I've never seriously grinded to reach a goal; I've just randomly done problems, sometimes a lot of them, mostly for fun and for my own satisfaction, and somehow I've accidentally achieved goals along the way. because when I've tried to actually fixate on goals, it feels less fun and more of a game that you try to win, and other oly ppl feel more like competitors than just friends. so I'd rather just get better at math and make more friends, and accidentally achieve goals, than vice versa.<br>
I have to quote Boxcars2015 because what he said about the oly math community is so true...
<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">Boxcars2015's blog wrote:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">one of my favorite things about the olympiad math community is that, even at the highest level where everyone is competing with each other, we are still generally very friendly towards one another and talk about solutions together after the test like we are on the same team.</div>

			<div class="message">I used to really like art<br>
<br>
in particular, drawing - between 3rd and 10th grades I would often randomly doodle with pencil, often on my math papers, and often images of humans<br>
but barely anyone knows this because I didn’t really tell anyone because 1) I never thought of myself as <i>good</i> at drawing so I didn’t want to have my skill judged and also I didn’t want to feel pressure to be good at drawing because I thought it was a waste of time, and 2) art was kinda looked down upon in my household; my parents were much more strict back then than they are now, and whenever I was caught drawing they would tell me to go read a book instead. so I ended up doing all my drawings in secret, erasing every one after I drew it, and not showing anyone else except for maybe my sister (who was like 4 years old at the time and actually enjoyed looking at my drawings, and didn't know it was "illegal" so she wouldn't tell anyone). thus I have basically zero actual records of my drawings, since I was very careful not to leave any in places where my family members could find them.<br>
<br>
I guess I drew because it was relaxing, and someone helped me get out my emotions whenever they were particularly strong. in fact, I was kinda addicted to drawing - there were times when I couldn’t do math for more than like an hour before starting to doodle on my paper. and I became aware of what the addiction was doing to my work ethic, but it would be a while before I would actually have motivation to do something about it.<br>
<br>
over time, I grew from a barely busy middle schooler to a very busy high schooler, and I realized that the urge to draw in the blank spaces of my math papers was actually inhibiting my ability to learn math - producing a drawing I was satisfied with often took quite a while, and if I didn’t have this desire I could quite possibly get many problems done in that time. so finally, in April 2022, 7-ish years after I first started drawing, I swore to stop and mentally banned myself from drawing. I was pretty sure the reason why so many other people were so much better at math than I was, was because they didn’t waste time drawing (which was definitely partly true). and it worked - the desire to draw on my scratch paper gradually dissipated, and I have zero such desire now. I guess in a way, I sacrificed my drawing skill for math skill.<br>
<br>
it was around that time that I became addicted to geo. sometime in April 2022, my scratch paper turned from numbers and scribbles and the shadows of erased drawings to basically 100% geo diagrams. I guess geo has filled the void that is my desire to have something aesthetic to look at. I may have half forgotten how to draw, but my life is still as artistic as ever.<br>
<br>

			<div class="message">so, as you may know, they shuffle the red 1 and 2 groups partway through mop.<br>
<br>
let's think way too deeply about this.<br>
<br>
the intent of this is presumably to get students to meet different people, which i will discuss below.<br>
<br>
so, here are my thoughts on this:<br>
<br>
swapping the groups does take a while to get used to, as your class now has a significant number of different people. if you were used to groupsolving with a certain group, you might now have to find a new group. I'd imagine that if you were one of the people that got moved, you would also have to get used to the new room location and conditions.<br>
<br>
but of course, the benefit is that it allows students to meet new people in class.<br>
<br>
which begs the question: how do you shuffle in a way that maximizes the amount of interaction?<br>
<br>
so, let's define the amount of interaction as the number of pairs of students <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/e/8/8e8da0aef2d19017da7471378386d61620f288f5.png" class="latex" alt="$(a,b)$" style="vertical-align: -4px" width="38" height="18"> such that <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/7/d/c7d457e388298246adb06c587bccd419ea67f7e8.png" class="latex" alt="$a$" width="9" height="8"> and <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/1/3/8136a7ef6a03334a7246df9097e5bcc31ba33fd2.png" class="latex" alt="$b$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="10" height="14"> were together in the same group at least once. we want to maximize the number of such pairs. There are 28 people in red. assume that both before and after the shuffle, there are 14 in each group.<br>
<br>
the interesting thing is, this is actually equivalent to <i>minimizing</i> the number of pairs of people that are together twice, since if we count it with multiplicity, we always get <span style="white-space:pre;"><img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/d/f/cdff62f90274dcb57d7d646a930cc5ff4415aae2.png" class="latex" alt="$4{14\choose 2}=364$" style="vertical-align: -23px" width="109" height="55">,</span> so we want to minimize the overcount.<br>
<br>
say that a pair of two people <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/e/8/8e8da0aef2d19017da7471378386d61620f288f5.png" class="latex" alt="$(a,b)$" style="vertical-align: -4px" width="38" height="18"> are <i>great</i> if <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/c/7/d/c7d457e388298246adb06c587bccd419ea67f7e8.png" class="latex" alt="$a$" width="9" height="8"> and <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/1/3/8136a7ef6a03334a7246df9097e5bcc31ba33fd2.png" class="latex" alt="$b$" style="vertical-align: -1px" width="10" height="14"> were together both before and after the shuffle.<br>
<br>
suppose <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/7/4/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" class="latex" alt="$n$" width="10" height="8"> people in red 1 originally move to red 2. then, the number of great pairs formed by two students originally in red 1 is <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/4/d/e4d9f4386ae2ff8011bf3ede30b7d6eb90db3219.png" class="latexcenter" alt="$${n\choose 2}+{{14-n}\choose 2}$$" width="132" height="53">as there are <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/c/3/2c35fd06fc4218af38b78fcaa835cb9a92daa6b9.png" class="latex" alt="${n\choose 2}$" style="vertical-align: -22px" width="35" height="53"> pairs that will stay together but move to red 2 and <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/6/3/a/63ad008eeceaece8d67bd989ca0ba2a811f5693c.png" class="latex" alt="${14-n\choose 2}$" style="vertical-align: -23px" width="81" height="55"> that stay together in red 1. now, we will use, you guessed it, <b>Jensen's Inequality</b>!<br>
<br>
By Jensen, <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/d/1/5d12c6391c21dfe43823bb37f0bb646446c319c8.png" class="latexcenter" alt="$${n\choose 2}+{{14-n}\choose 2}\geq 2{7\choose 2}=42,$$" width="253" height="53">which equality at <span style="white-space:pre;"><img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/7/f/f7f0f830b5b25ea929198068e407e8c9f62f56c4.png" class="latex" alt="$n=7$" width="44" height="12">.</span> Thus, there are at least 42 great pairs formed by a pair of students originally in red 1. similarly, at least 42 from pairs originally in red 2, so there are at least 84 great pairs. hence, the number of distinct pairs that have met at least once is at most <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/0/f/20fb7e792432d5d8085fa2df856dff6e7e0f21a3.png" class="latexcenter" alt="$$364-84=280.$$" width="121" height="12"><br>
the equality case is when 7 people from red 1 move to red 2, and vice versa, which we can check does indeed achieve 280. now that i think about it, moving half of each group into the other group, is essentially changing up the environment as much as possible.<br>
<br>
if i remember correctly what the groupings were before shuffle, the mop staff did indeed do this.<br>
<br>
originally, when the shuffle was announced, i didn't really like the idea, as i would have to get used to the new group and the new environment, but now that i think deeply about it, it is a change for the good, allowing far more interaction and meaningful relationships among the students<br>
<br>
let's end off this post with a clincher line, describing the result we discovered above:<br>
<br>
"to encourage new connections, we need to alter the situation as much as possible."<br>
<br>

			<div class="message">idrk what is going on<br>
weirdly, the set of things that I spend time on hasn't really changed since before mop (although I'm spending more time on certain things and less on others)<br>
I kinda expected it to change more<br>
I half expected to like, not really be doing math anymore<br>
but I can't imagine what life would be like without doing math<br>
so I'm going to cling on to math for as long as possible <span class="bbfont-half">well more like geo</span><br>
so anyway, my schedule basically consists of discord spamming, hso browsing, occasionally testsolving others' geo problems, athemath work, and exercising with family a tiny bit<br>
very productive I know<br>
also my sleep schedule is still 11-7 (first time in a while I'm actually not at all sleep deprived <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> )<br>
I also created a small website <a href="https://v4913.github.io/" class="bbcode_url" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://v4913.github.io/</a> with help from a certain other person, because I needed to learn how to use github for athemath purposes. there's basically nothing on the website but aesthetic geo diagrams lol<br>
<br>
oh yeah I also need to study for sat and ap bio but w h o   c a r e s    a b o u t    t h a t I'm probably going to be procrastinating until August :///</div>

1. <b>sleep schedule permanently shifted later.</b> idk if I’ll ever have a 9-5 sleep schedule again but for now it’s like 11-7 which is I guess way more normal. it does enable me to socialize with ppl at night more, and although I might not be as productive as I was before, I don’t really care<br>
2. <b>not caring <i>as</i> much about math.</b> maybe this is just a thing that happens over time, but there’s just less motivation to grind now that I really only have at most a year left and can’t make mop again. I’ll still try with math, and like do geo for fun, but I’m probably not going to <i>hardcore</i> grind.<br>
3. <b>being on discord constantly, and having like no motivation to spend time on any other social media sites.</b> I feel like talking to my friends constantly (mostly moppers oops I should maybe try to talk in non-mop servers like otis more) so I’m literally either being productive or on discord. I used to occasionally waste time on Instagram but now I crave social interaction so much that if I don’t feel like being productive, I’ll immediately go on discord. there’s no point wasting time in other ways anymore.<br>
(ok hopefully the last one is not permanent because I’m only able to be on discord constantly since it’s summer and I have relatively little to do..)</div>

			<div class="message">I don’t really want to think of myself as a MOPper, or some other accomplishment I have. I don’t want to split other people into groups based on those who have and don’t have a certain accomplishment, either. because there’s no fundamental difference between getting a score of x or x-1 on a test. but society gives those in the former group a huge confidence boost and opportunity after opportunity, while the latter group gets nothing.<br>
<br>
MOP really is kind of an elitist circle. there’s practically no difference skill-wise between a mopper and someone who nearly missed MOP, but colleges can’t really tell and so ~60 people get some random label slapped onto their resume which gets them into certain social circles.<br>
<br>
even within MOP, there are social cliques, many of them split along the lines of the color groups. the better you happen to be at math, the more elite you are. and at math competitions and other math camps, the moppers kind of form their own circle (which partly makes sense because they know each other pretty well from the 3 weeks they spent together), and it’s all like some elite party that those who were unlucky didn’t make and as a result are not part of.<br>
<br>
I don’t think there should be a social divide between MOPpers and non-MOPpers, black MOPpers and non-black MOPpers, olympiad qualifiers and non-olympiad qualifiers. someone should not be looked down upon because they didn’t MOP. in fact, there should not even be an assumption made about their skill level if they didn’t MOP, because so much of it is up to luck anyway. I kinda just want to interact with the math community like any random person, and I don’t want our accomplishments to separate us, online or at in-person gatherings. everyone in the math community is fundamentally one big family of people who enjoy thinking about math problems and challenging themselves.<br>
<br>
and so I don’t really feel like going to MOAC - I don’t want to be reminded of anything I’ve achieved that might set me apart from other people. because there is nothing fundamentally different between someone who qualified for x and someone who didn’t, although society makes there be a bit of friction between the two for some reason. I wish this friction didn’t exist, and everyone was able to move about freely instead of being separated into categories by their achievements.<br>
<br>
I guess the main motivation to go to MOAC would be to see people, but I don’t have very much desire to see just the small group of “elite” people who are going, and I can see them at math competitions anyway.<br>
<br>
SPARC and Atlas are even more questionable, because there literally is NO difference between someone who qualified and someone who didn’t. it’s not even like they got a lower score on a contest, it’s literally just that the admissions person thought they “weren’t as good a fit”, for a very very questionable definition of “a good fit”. and so fundamentally, qualifying for one of these programs means absolutely nothing and is barely less random than a lottery. I guess I’m just going because it’s free and I’ll get to talk to people, which will be more interesting than staying at home.<br>
<br>
anyway, qualifications are overrated in my opinion and people spend too much time thinking about them and dividing each other into groups based off of them. there is so much more to a person than that which can be expressed by a few numbers.</div>

			<div class="message">just spamming this blog in an attempt to cope<br>
<br>
so in my head, MOP 2023 was divided into 3 parts:<br>
<br>
<b>Part 1: Awe</b><br>
basically just marveling at the fact that such a place could even exist. realizing how much fun the next few weeks would be. this was the happiest and most carefree time.<br>
<br>
<b>Part 2: Stress</b><br>
during tstst week and the days leading up to it, tstst was the main thing on everyone’s mind. it caused serious mental health problems for many people, as discussing tstst was something many people couldn’t stop doing but also something many people couldn’t bear to hear. the insane amount of stress from peer pressure, parents, and themselves caused many people to temporarily forget about the fun of mop. this was a rough time, but we would get through it together.<br>
<br>
<b>Part 3: Slow Motion</b><br>
after tstst ended, we suddenly realized that there were only a few days left, and so we tried so hard to savor every moment and make the most out of this extremely short amount of time. we sacrificed sleep and math time to socialize, and make as many memories as we could. the closer we got to the end, the stronger the desire was to slow down time. these were the saddest moments, but also the happiest because we realized we really were one big family. this was also a rather peaceful time because any negative feelings (mostly related to tstst) were mostly gone and we were all feeling the same mixture of happiness and dread for the end.<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
this year’s mop was so much different for me than last year’s. first of all, I felt like I was supposed to be somewhat of a role model given that most of the camp was younger than me, and so I sometimes tried to be non-degenerate. secondly, last year I spent most of my time with one group of people, and as a result became very close to them. this year, I spent a significant amount of time with just one person, and as a result we are now very very very close. but despite how different they were, both experiences were very moving, and the two best months of my life.<br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
I’ve changed so much in the past year. like, <i>so</i> much. I think the things I care about are now completely different. there’s such a big difference between being a rising junior and a rising senior. to use Advaith’s terms, I might be becoming soft. summer 2022 me would be so disappointed to find that I no longer have the motivation or work ethic to actually try as hard as I can, and am now distracting myself with other things instead of trying to shoot for the moon. or maybe summer 2022 me would be proud that I’m not completely burned out like many other rising seniors are. I used to think that thinking too much about philosophical things was a waste of time, but now it’s my entire life. I don’t even really know what to even care about anymore.</div>

sometimes I wonder whether something so dreamlike as that was even real. all of you, with extraordinary math talent and some of the kindest hearts ever, definitely don’t seem to be. putting everyone together under one roof for three weeks creates the most magical blend of smarts, wisdom, and degeneracy that is so unique to MOP. you don’t have to try to fit in here, you just naturally do because everyone is so welcoming and surprisingly similar to you.<br>
<br>
I’m probably not coming back to MOP as a student, but Stever will forever be my home. I don’t think I belong anywhere else in the world more. I’m going to miss MOP culture so much, from the college math nerds talking jargon about the Ordinals, to the verbal spamming of catchy phrases that everyone outside of mop would ridicule, to the mock feuds between groups like the geo mains and the bash mains, the MOPpers and the Turtle.<br>
<br>
we learned to face our greatest fears, - <i>close our eyes, and leap</i> - as we did every other day in HoA. we reassured each other that it was okay if we underperformed, that we still 100% belonged even if every one of us had impostor syndrome, and that certain problems were just too idiotic to be sad about not solving. in three weeks we have forged some of the most amazing friendships which are strong enough to withstand anything, including the tstst.<br>
<br>
this year, as one of the older moppers, I can’t help but be so happy about the direction the math community is headed. so many young children have, throughout these three weeks, been inspired to both get even stronger at math and even more aware of the world outside math. and you all have such determined, optimistic minds which will enable you to accomplish anything you want to. I can’t wait to see how far you all will have gotten in a few years.<br>
<br>
…<br>
today, everyone was suddenly plucked off CMU campus by the 28X and various cars, and the place suddenly turned into a ghost town. for the next few days, whenever I pass by CMU, I’ll be half expecting to see a mopper walking along the sidewalks. if I hear an excited, high-pitched voice, I’ll half expect it to be Holden’s. and the tunes of Singing Troupe will echo around CMU campus for months to come. it’s almost as if I’ll need to avoid CMU campus for a couple of days, or weeks, to escape the disappointment of my hallucinations not being real. of MOP actually being <i>over</i>. of the reality that I might actually be age blocked next year, but in the other way. slowly the images will fade and I’ll wonder <i>if it was all just a beautiful fantasy. or if it was all just imaginary.</i><br>
<br>
MOP was just so amazing, I’d stay there forever even if I got swept by a test every other day. I love you all!!!</div>

			<div class="message">just when we were getting comfortably into the swing of things and used to mop life, something dreadful snuck up behind us: the tstst.<br>
the fact that tstst exists now makes the atmosphere much more tense; you can tell some people are stressing really hard about it, others are elated that they did well, and others are depressed that they did sub-optimally. but the vast majority of moppers are disappointed in some way, because it’s hard to be satisfied when you know you could’ve done better.<br>
and then there is that small handful of moppers who just doesn’t care, and truly tries to enjoy the problems and doesn’t care how well they do. that is the healthiest mindset, and I really admire the people with that mindset - I think not stressing can actually lead one to do better, literally and mentally, than stressing would.<br>
<br>
I kinda wish I didn’t care so much, but I want to push myself to make EGMO again - it’s kinda selfish, chasing an opportunity that I’ve already gotten twice and that any truly kind soul would pass onto some younger child - but challenges are enticing sometimes and the experience <i>is</i> truly amazing, whether it’s your first or third time going. and let’s just say there’s an unusually large amount of competition for EGMO this year so I’m going to have to actually have to try hard. but like Eyed said, giving it your all one last time is pretty symbolic.<br>
<br>
and I am trying to enjoy the problems. I find myself enjoying more nongeo problems recently, which is maybe caused by the fact that I’m actually doing some nongeo.. especially combo. some types of combo really are beautiful (but still not as beautiful as geo in my opinion lol)<br>
<br>
certain people at mop who like The Great Gatsby have created the term East Egg and West Egg camps/programs, which I think is really interesting (and sad). basically the unfortunate reality is that to get into most camps, you have to already have achievements other than like “AIME qualifier” or something. often, because there are so many oly qualifiers and not enough camp spots for all of them, making MOP really helps your chances of getting in. so in a way, making MOP, (which is completely based off of objective skill and so like West Egg in a way), is like the first door in a series of doors. once you make it, you are presented with more opportunities and now have a higher chance of getting into everything else. and the cycle continues - once you have more accomplishments and seized opportunities on your resume, you are presented with even more possibilities. the camps and programs which care about all of your various accomplishments are kinda like East Egg, because you have to ALREADY have accomplishments to get in, and that’s why MOP, the only purely objective camp out there, is so unique and special.<br>
<br>
this phenomenon is really sad in a way, because many people who are between AIME and MOP level just have a really hard time grasping hold of any opportunities, and so, in terms of opportunities, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.<br>
<br>
something else kinda unrelated that I’ve observed at mop is that the red/green moppers grind math a lot more than blue/black. (classes also roughly increase in degeneracy as you go up the color groups). generally, the younger moppers are more focused on trying hard with math because I guess they have years of opportunities ahead of them, and could become so amazing math-wise if they set their minds to it. and older moppers, especially those who won’t be able to come back to mop again in the future, are no longer completely focused on math goals, and instead want to make the most out of mop socially, because relationships will still exist after 10 years while math skill probably won’t. there is a very wide spectrum of mindsets people have at mop, ranging from trying to have as much fun socializing as possible to isolating 24/7 to grind math. it’s very interesting, and I respect both points of view. I think I’m somewhere in the middle because I still do care about math (it’s just so hard to let go), but mop is also the only time during the whole year when I can see a lot of my friends, and so every second is precious.</div>

			<div class="message">mop has been amazing so far, and I feel like if I continue to enjoy it this much, I don’t even know if I’ll be that sad at the end when it’s over because I’ll be overwhelmed by how much happiness I just lived through<br>
to put it another way, mop will supply enough happiness to last the whole year and for it to last longer would be like overdosing on happiness<br>
maybe there were days of sun interspersed throughout the rest of the year, but mop is a whole month of sun.<br>
<br>
I’m not even really worried about the tests anymore. I don’t even care that much about making EGMO. like the team leaders have said in the past, not making it would mean giving the opportunity to someone new who would honestly probably benefit a lot more from it than a veteran like me. but I’m still going to try of course - like Eyed said, giving oly one last real try is so <i>symbolic</i>. so much has changed since last year. I don’t even feel that much like grinding math because mop is basically the only time of the year when I can see a lot of my friends, and grinding math is something I can do at home.<br>
<br>
and so I’m just hoping that when mop ends, instead of being slightly depressed like last year, I’ll be a tiny bit relieved - because had it continued for longer, I might’ve lost my sanity amidst all the happiness<br>
mop is one of those things that is so good it shouldn’t exist. I don’t even know if I’m alive right now, or dreaming.</div>

			<div class="message">Sunday was a free day, and I guess I didn’t do much that day<br>
yesterday was another “normal” day I guess.<br>
here are some things that happened in no particular order
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>played secret hitler on Sunday and certain people kept being hitler; I was somehow liberal every single game which somehow always happens to me; not gonna complain tho cuz I’m absolute trash at playing fascist LMAO oops T_T</li>
<li>attempted to run this improv thing on Sunday with two other daily challenge moppers; it quickly devolved into chaos and was basically just a massive amount of trolling but was really fun lmao</li>
<li>I’m back in green and yesterday’s classes were actually really fun! it was nice being able to do nonzero problems and understand what was happening! I think the environment in green is much more conducive to learning than blue because people just troll too much in blue, and I actually learn a lot more in blue..</li>
<li>test 2 happened yesterday and I think it was <i>okay</i> unless I fakesolved problems again T_T I literally have like a 50% fakesolve rate so far..</li>
<li>yesterday was a very rainy day so a lot of ppl were late to class</li>
<li>more irl orzing happened (people bowing to each other on the ground), and some illegal nametag swapping happened too</li>
<li>still really tired yesterday even though I had gotten 7.5 hours of sleep :skull:</li>
<li>geo groupsolves are quickly turning into our friend group clowning and being really unproductive lol (maybe partly because we were all so tired).. how to be productive.. tbh building relationships/friendships is one of the most important parts of mop tho, because it’s the only time of the year when you can actually see some friends irl for an extended period of time T_T</li>
<li>trying to comfort friends who are sad T_T</li>

			<div class="message">one part of mop that idk if ppl realize at first is just how stressful it is. there are tests every other day so we’re constantly taking tests, getting tests back, or getting ready for tests. I know mop is supposed to be a rigorous training camp so having lots of tests is kinda mandatory. but the environment <i>is</i> very conducive to bad mental health problems relating to test scores. I know that at least 3 of my friends excluding myself have had mental breakdowns after tests. we should try to be here for each other more often, and maybe place less importance on tests but the latter seems very difficult T_T<br>
<br>
one thing that makes mop strange is that ur competitors are ur friends, so you either abandon the competitive part and be friends, or abandon friends and be competitive<br>
<br>
oh right yeah I have a lot of ELMO work to do rn D:</div>

			<div class="message">ok some very major events happened yesterday..<br>
<br>
most importantly, I moved to green<br>
Evan and the graders initially didn’t let me move to green for some stupid reason like “you qualified for blue so go to blue” but I swear to god I’m not good enough at math for blue<br>
I absolutely failed the first mop test and had a genuine mental breakdown in front of 4 graders and begged them to let me move to green and maybe that convinced them<br>
second time I’ve cried in the past year, and again over a mop test<br>
there are other reasons why I want to move to green too, including that maybe I can try to make green more talkative (it’s apparently a very quiet class and has little camaraderie) and that I want to be able to actually answer questions and solve problems unlike my past 2 years of mop. blue (nongeo) classes are like very barely doable for me but I’m not good enough to like actually answer questions.<br>
<br>
anyway that mop test completely destroyed my self confidence LMFAO<br>
anyway mop is still very fun but maybe I should like spend more time actually doing math or smth so I can stop being so bad at math. I need to stop being a clown.</div>

<li>experienced my second and third blue classes, during which I sat with squareman, CT17, rjiangbz, CB, and RM, and we basically clowned the entire class lmfao.. stuff that happened included CT17 cutting his nametag lanyard in half, rjiangbz writing 1434 on his umbrella, and using his computer as a chalkboard. very entertaining and I think if I stay in blue I’m not going to be bored by a class ever again LOL.</li>
<li>we are the most mature and productive moppers fr :rofl:</li>
<li>first test.. no comment</li>
<li>impromptu singing troupe while walking (when will singing troupe start lmao)</li>
<li>being really high after like 7pm again because I got 6 hours of sleep (which is actually a record high given that I usually get less). I am slowly learning how to function while sleep deprived lol..</li>
<li>watching IAmTheHazard write up his solution to usamo p3 after 3 months</li>
<li>another geo groupsolve at 10pm when we were all really high; we spent forever on some easy problems lol and RM dumped his whole pencil case on the couch for some reason. the size comparison between RM’s and CT17’s diagrams is so funny.</li>

mop is actual literal heaven I swear<br>
like to the point that idk how sad I’ll be when it ends because nothing <i>that good</i> can possibly last that long, and even to have it happen for 3 weeks is enough for a lifetime</div>

			<div class="message">the entire day I was high on 4 hours of sleep so after 7pm I was basically trying very hard not to fall asleep<br>
in the early morning a little bit of geo, aops blog spamming, and unproductivity happens in the piano room (imagine piano orz)<br>
<br>
then we go to breakfast and class. I decided to go to green for the morning classes partly cuz I’m a little scared of ZD who was teaching blue. the green classes were actually fun; it was nice not being completely swept by all the problems and green is a really nice group of ppl. I think it’s actually the class I belong in. I’m so sad to leave y’all :///<br>
but anyway then I got in a little bit of trouble for going to the wrong class and am forced to go to blue now T_T<br>
<br>
I went to blue for homework review, and holy sht it is so much more degen and hilarious than green - maybe it’s partly due to the way homework review was run but it kinda feels like a tight knit friend group having fun joking around while maybe pretending to do math. what a huge difference from green, who are an actually sane group of kids actually trying to do math.<br>
anyway I should probably not judge color groups too hard if I’ve only seen one of their classes :flushed:<br>
I also really hope crazyeyemoody907 can move to blue since he is definitely blue level (and like literally better than me at math) but Evan Chen is apparently very strict about color group switches this year T_T <span style="color:#f0f">:flushed:</span><br>
<br>
the highlight of blue homework review was i3435 spending half an hour explaining his DIT solution to the kosnita point problem XD<br>
then I went to a mandatory elmo meeting during which I basically didn’t pay attention for most of it and tried to do an IGO problem with CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid (we reduced it to something simple but still couldn’t prove the last part ahhh)<br>
then we went back to the dorms and had these 1-on-1’s with staff members, and like basically fooled around being unproductive the rest of the time<br>
<br>
then dinner happened, and after that was a lecture on complex bashing during which me and some of other hardcore synthetic geo mains (including CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid, ApraTrip, crazyeyemoody907, thanosaops) actively revolted by doing synthetic geo in the same room; we tried some impossible Taiwan TST problem and eventually actually came up with a working solution path (I literally didn’t do anything tho, it was all them LOL)<br>
then we went outside for Storytime which was actually pretty interesting.. dottedcaculator just had to rickroll us tho<br>
<br>
ok now for the very interesting part: the geo cult went to our meeting room on the 4th floor at 10pm and everyone decided to be really degenerate. some non geo mains including DottedCaculator and rjiangbz joined and some things which happened were: lots of people being quoted for saying suspicious stuff, computers being forcibly grabbed and typed on by people other than their owners, singing mop songs out loud (including their parodies), people being physically orzed to the point that they curled up on the ground, and several ppl actually attempting geo (but I was way too tired so I just clowned around). at 11pm we dispersed and that was the end of the very eventful day!<br>
<br>
today there is a test so it’s time to actually get fried in blue!!!</div>

			<div class="message">ok I am no longer being very productive<br>
yesterday there were no classes so I was mostly clowning around with a bunch of ppl (mostly geo mains) and pretending to do geo but actually being quite unproductive LOL<br>
we discovered the <i>fourth floor</i> which is a pretty nice place<br>
we also played secret hitler<br>
I haven’t decided whether to be in green or blue yet<br>
I also couldn’t really sleep last night again after 2:30am; I definitely didn’t go off campus at 4am by myself cuz I couldn’t sleep; I managed to half sleep for a few hours after that<br>
first day of classes; hope I don’t die lol</div>

			<div class="message">before I become really unproductive at mop and spend all my time socializing <strike>and become really bad at math</strike><br>
oops I haven’t been socializing that much recently <strike>geo addiction really hitting hard</strike><br>
I also actually for once did a few nongeo problems yesterday because we were having some pre mop groupsolve<br>
I also have been having trouble sleeping recently, probably because I’m way too excited. the dorm is comfortable, but I often have trouble sleeping when excited.. so I slept 11-2 and 4-5 last night lmao, and could not sleep between those two intervals<br>
anyway I guess I’ll have to learn to be productive even on low amounts of sleep <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
I know color groups don’t matter but I think im gonna be swept by all the tests if I stay in blue, which will be pretty sad. still thinking about if I want to be in blue or green.<br>
oh yeah and a lot of ppl from egmo, including the Romanian girl who I said in a previous post has the most genuine smile, are at mop!!! international ppl are cool lol<br>
anyway the best month of my life has been going great so far!!</div>

it's kinda sad how my arml team is like rly close for a couple days a year and just rly scattered (socially) the other 363 days of the year<br>
2 of my teammates are coming to my school for high school tho which is insane, like literally no math ppl ever come to my school<br>
I also met way too many ppl to name!!! <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"></div><br>

because I think I deserved exactly this score<br>
and a lot of my friends, including ones I think are way better than me at math, got exactly this score<br>
its weird -- in society there's pressure to be the same as other ppl, but in competitions it's the opposite; ur supposed to try to score higher than other ppl<br>
but I think there's some comfort in scoring <i>the same as everyone else</i>; at least you can fit in<br>
weird take but winning feels kinda lonely</div><br>
also I finished school on friday, officially not going back to junior year..<br>
will probably be more active on blog but I won't have time to rant about deep stuff so I might just dump stuff that is happening</div>

the one good thing about small schools with not many sweaty ppl is that it's easy to get leadership positions (although they are less significant)<br>
<br>
today was the seniors' last day of school and they did some very interesting pranks such as covering the stairwells with chairs, putting pasta in huge glass decorative bowl, and holding a mock wedding between 2 random ppl who are not in any sort of a real relationship (but the entire thing was pure comedy, everyone involved in it was very theatrically experienced and it was extremely hilarious)<br>
im kinda gonna miss that grade ngl. they had a lot of personality and positive energy and the school's just gonna feel so empty without them. and they're like by far more sophisticated and tight-knit than any of the other grades; they're all like a billion times more mature than any of us; so I guess we have a lot to live up to..<br>
there is one nice thing about being the oldest grade in the school tho, which is that there's a feeling of control like there are no students higher up in the hierarchy who are by default have authority and are going to tell us what to do... ahh I feel so old...<br>
<br>
now that the seniors are gone though, like half of my classes have basically no one left so we're just doing basically nothing which is GREAT <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> and basically all my projects/tests are done so I can <strike>be lazy</strike>, waste lots of time, and actually get enough sleep <img src="/assets/images/smilies/gleam.gif" alt=":gleam:" title=":gleam:" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">gotta grind chinese project tonight but basically everything is ending<br>
my school doesn't rly have finals so the last few weeks should be pretty relaxing<br>
it was a rly weird feeling finishing AP's last week. I expected to be like really relieved, like a weight was lifted off of me. and that kinda did happen, but I'm not any less tired than before or have significantly less obligations than before. the only difference is that instead of binging crash course videos in the morning, I waste time on discord or do geo, and I guess I can stop feeling guilty for not spending every chance I get studying for AP's. <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">about AP's</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none"><strike>we don't talk about how badly I did on a few</strike><br>
I think I either took too many AP's this year or underestimated the amount of time I'd need to study on them or both<br>
because basically the entirety of late April - early May I was scrambling to prepare for AP's in way too little time which is kinda like a recipe for failure</div><br>
in a way, my life feels a tiny bit empty now. maybe stressing over things is part of what makes life exciting, and thus is not always a bad thing. I've been stressing over stuff for the past 9 months straight, and for it to all be over just seems really weird. (ofc TSTST exists but that's later)<br>
anyway, I can't believe junior year is almost over; I have like 8 more days of school. what the heck; that went by so fast?!?? it was September and then somehow November and then in a blink it's May<br>
this was by far the most stressful year, but also the best year, by a long shot. it literally could not have been better - I got lucky with many, many things.<br>
I thought I would never get through it; I thought I would die many times, on all the egmo tst's and the usamo and every other math comp, but somehow I'm alive... and more alive than ever, in a way.</div>

			<div class="message">oops I need to actually do better in school; there's a good chance I will end the year with like a B in bio :skull: <strike>im boutta be rejected from colleges for my terrible grades lmao</strike><br>
at school right now for this stem presentation night thing ._. how to actually be good at presenting lmao, everyone at my school is so good at it fsr<br>
after this week it should all be over tho<br>
<br>
because of my really bad time management, and my habit to [do x thing that I do way too much of but am addicted to] instead of doing other things, I have been not getting enough sleep (maybe why my eyes have been kinda bloodshot for the past few days) AND failing school, oops<br>
but its ok... everything is ok...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
also, I have realized the purpose of my life is to break social norms. yall should read jelfin's blogpost about breaking social norms; it's so good. now that I think about it, the motivation behind so many things that I've done are to break social norms. I have really weird motivations for things tbh.<br>
I think this partly comes from my parents, because their goal is also to break social norms.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
also, I have realized that I love high school. I love being defined by just the things I am passionate about, rather than where I live, or more importantly, what school I go to. I love being a random entity existing somewhere on the planet, or maybe on discord, without real responsibilities or anything I actually have to <i>do</i> or the need to be mature, and not really being tied down to any place or physical thing. and not being attached to things is nice because people aren't going to judge or stereotype me for it. high schools are mismatched medleys of all different sorts of people, so interacting with other high schoolers from around the country or the world doesn't feel like we're venturing out of our comfort zone or college campus because there is no comfort zone; I feel 0 emotional connection to my school or city and probably the same is true for lots of other ppl. which makes it easy to forget everything real about life and focus on the abstract, which is more interesting. I don't really want to attach myself to a place, or a college name, or be weighed down by responsibilities like adults are. I don't really want to be tethered to a group of people at all.<br>
in particular, I don't want my friends and I to go to college, because I'm worried that we'll stop being random entities existing arbitrarily, and actually find belonging in different pockets of the world. I would rather belong nowhere than in one place.</div>

			<div class="message">I think I need to be more observant. I’m really nearsighted, in a lot of ways. physically I’m very incapable of seeing things that are more than a trivial distance away without contacts or glasses, but also a lot of my focus is willingly on things right in front of me, such as geo diagrams or electronic devices, or things very close in the future, such as high school, because things farther away are difficult to see and often unclear, which makes me less willing to think about them. and this stubbornness to see things farther away sometimes makes me naive and not notice what is actually happening.<br>
<br>
there was a period of time during my childhood (4th through 7th grade or smth) when I was clearly nearsighted but refused to wear any vision aids, so I just got used to seeing the world through a blurry lens. since seeing the big picture was sometimes hard for me, I ended up spending a lot of time focusing on the close-up, such as math or books or the computer. I got used to not paying attention to anything more than a few feet away from me. my brother (and normal other kids) would notice things like planes in the sky and interestingly shaped trees, etc, and I wouldn’t be able to see them clearly, so I kinda stopped caring. instead of questioning why the world was the way it was, like I should have, I kinda just accepted that things were how they were, accepted that people acted how they did, was obedient instead of questioning people, etc. now I can see clearly (at least physically), but I still need to learn to be more observant, notice details in the world that may not be the way they should, be more careful instead of believing everyone and everything, and be more open minded about things that may seem farther than a few feet away.<br>
<br>
maybe I need to take a step back and look at the big picture.</div>

I know this is really really unhealthy because eventually I’m going to take an oly with no geo and COMPLETELY FAIL (and uh the TSTST example was more or less a fail cuz I didn’t make TST group) but <i>the more I continue to (more or less) succeed with a majority of my points from geo, the more I feel like being a hardcore geo main</i>. the more I get a majority of my points from geo, the stronger the urge is to have that happen again, but ideally with a bigger <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">total</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">the issue is when this maximum possible total is not large enough.</div>. maybe I’m trying to prove a point - to myself, or to the world - that it’s possible to be a really definitive one subject main*. but of course I should probably get a little better at it for this to actually be true.<br>
<br>
anyway, geo continues to push me forward, <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">figuratively</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">because not only is it kinda practically useful but it's also good for relaxation purposes</div> and literally. I think I’m addicted.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">* to be clear I'm not even <i>that</i> good at geo, I'm just 10000000 times worse at everything else</span><br>
<span style="color:#f0f">says the person who solved usamo 2023/6 synthetically</span> <span style="color:#f00">pure luck lol</span></div>

			<div class="message"><strike>there are none.</strike> well at least, we are much less close than before. maybe becoming less close to your siblings is a side effect of growing up and like having your own lives outside of family life - but somehow I don’t think this is exactly true because I also know in lots of cases siblings actually become <i>closer</i> together after growing up, maybe because they don’t fight as much<br>
and we don’t fight as much, but still we are farther apart<br>
<br>
I think the real reason for our loss of connection is that my siblings have a tiny bit of bitterness towards me, since my parents have tried hard to make all three of us find doing math fun and so far its kinda only worked on me. well, my sister, who’s 9, is currently in the phase pretty early on in math learning where you have to figure out how to deal with being stuck/frustrated on a problem and this is really hard. (she's okay with doing easy problems, and in fact really likes this, but hard problems are a different story.) probably the toughest part of learning contest math (or anything) is just starting out because it just seems so difficult and overwhelming.<br>
when I was going through this, I had a lot of <i>strong and forceful encouragement</i> from my mom to keep doing math; she spent a really long time trying to get me to understand why it was worth it to keep trying a problem even if it was really hard. without this encouragement, I don’t know if I would have survived the first - and most important - step towards actually doing competition math seriously. I think it’s probably also true for most of you that you got the initial push to start doing math from your parents, and it was probably somewhat forceful…<br>
however, my mom is really busy now and still tries to do this <i>strong and forceful encouragement</i> thing with my sister but she’s also gotten way more lenient since 8 years ago and so the <i>forcefulness</i> is much less forceful, i.e. my sister doesn’t get punished for not doing math and stuff. which has its benefits, but it's just not the same.<br>
but although they’ve gotten more lenient, my parents still care a lot about math - not so much the contest part of it, but the “doing it for the fun of it” part. so in order to avoid potential large conflicts between my parents and sister in the future (like what has been happening between my parents and brother recently), my sister probably needs to eventually learn to appreciate math, including the difficult parts of it.<br>
I think the most I can do to help her is encouraging her to keep doing math, and do math myself too, because if she sees no one else in the house doing math (my brother doesn’t really like math and so doesn’t really do it but that’s a different story), it can be really hard to bring herself to do it, given that she already sees it as pretty challenging.<br>
either that, or my parents undergo a paradigm shift towards no longer caring a lot about their kids having a lot of appreciation for, and being good at, math; which now that I think about it has actually been having very gradually for the past few years but it would have to speed up<br>
<br>
so yeah I think my siblings are a little bit (validly) salty towards me for being favored by our parents, which is really sad <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> I just want them to treat us all the same… I kinda want it to be elementary or middle school again during which my brother still liked math and my parents were still proud of him and we actually had fun together because there were no salty feelings involved.<br>
btw, I don’t think my siblings are to be blamed for the degradation of our relationship; I think it’s mostly due to my parents being super busy in the past few years (my dad is often away from home so being a single parent is hard for my mom) and thus paying little attention to them. I don’t think my parents should expect my siblings to have the same reaction to math as me, if they were raised quite differently from me. and it’s probably also my fault for not socializing a ton with them; I’m way closer to my friends on discord oops T_T<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the one biggest thing, by far, from childhood that I’ve lost, is this relationship. I hope it will someday be fixed - maybe when we all grow up and math contests are no longer the most important thing in our family and we can actually like do things that normal families do, idk. but I’m sorry for being a kinda irresponsible older sibling and not paying enough attention to the relationships that I should be. I hope that someday our parents will appreciate y’all as much as they should, and we will all be equal again.</div>

I can actually take a little break from cramming and maybe get more than 6 hours of sleep now!!! <strike>altho geometry and excitement will probably be keeping me awake and hence make it hard to sleep in the morning so I will probably continue to be sleep deprived </strike><br>
almost fell asleep during bio today (and kinda during the ap macro exam)<br>
paying attention in class is actually so hard tho, like if u start daydreaming for like 20 seconds u might miss smth very important :skull: why are school and focusing so hard<br>
I’ve also been very high the whole day (probably due to sleep deprivation) which might explain why I’ve been saying slightly more sus stuff than normal<br>

attempting 1 week speedrun of ap cs a<br>
I’ve learned like, maybe 2/3 of it in the past few days??? but there are still lots of random gaps and things I don’t understand<br>
ahh 2 more days to learn as much as I possibly can<br>
I think I understand like 4/5 of ap macro maybe; what even is the definition of understand<br>
but neither of these are enough to score sufficiently well<br>
<br>
ive also like lost the ability to actually sleep. I havent slept for &gt;=6 hours in a while. I think it's a combination of mandatory AP grind and being wayyyyyy too hyped for something that's happening in 34 days and hence not being able to sleep. so I'm physically quite exhausted, but very happy inside <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

<br>
I think I’m too used to winning, and need to learn how to lose again.<br>
<br>
unironically. there is a skill in being accustomed to losing and having to deal with failure which is that those setbacks don't affect you as much, and you're actually able to get back up from them and move on. this is actually an insanely powerful skill, and wish I had more of it. I think in becoming too used to happiness and success I've forgotten how to actually deal with sadness which is quite problematic in the long run. also, doing math comps has made me quite competitive. I unnecessarily envy peoples' math skill which is very irrational and I really wish it wasn't the case (ofc it doesn't get in the way of friendships tho; I have no negative feelings towards anyone). I think the more experience one gets with math comps, the more light there is in the distance, and greater is the desire to become even better, which may lead to even more hyper-competitiveness and even more desire to reach that light in the distance, which may lead one to forget about the real point of math competitions which is simply having fun challenging oneself and making memories. but in real life, there will be infinitely many people better than you so having this hyper-competitive mindset inherited from math competitions may actually be a really bad thing. <b>I need to stop envying people, period.</b> and in a way, I need to learn to lose again because math comps may be all about winning, but life is all about losing. in order to survive, one needs to be able to lose successfully.</div>

			<div class="message">I am trying to cram as much Macro and CS knowledge into my head as will fit; 6 and 5 days left for them respectively<br>
I think it all will instantly dissipate after the tests.. (which is actually kind of unfortunate cuz macro is actually a tiny bit useful)<br>
<br>
<br>
I think there is a very significant chance MOP 2023 will be the best month of my life. which is actually kinda sad given that I probably have a lot of years ahead of me, but MOP just cannot compare with real life. after going to MOP last year, I’ve realized that it’s pure magic. every first timer leaves having become a completely different person. for one, the MOP community is basically the most welcoming math community out there. maybe it’s because there’s no need to be super competitive anymore when everyone is proud of themselves deep down inside, and that allows them to actually care about, rather than simply competing with, each other. there is definitely nonzero correlation between math skill and kindness. the only thing better than a community of really nice people or a community of really smart people is really nice <i>and</i> smart people. this is why MOP is so magical, and I don’t think anything else on earth can compare with it.*<br>
<br>
each time, it just gets better. I’m actually not scared of (certain) moppers anymore, and have far less imposter syndrome than I used to. (maybe this is because most of them are younger than me now oops) given how amazing last year was, I can’t even imagine what it will be like without being scared of people.<br>
<br>
oh right, I need to ACTUALLY DO MATH in the next month (while also not failing APs..) because otherwise I’ll be like by far the worst person in my class :rofl: (and I very much know how that feels)<br>
<br>
it’s really unfortunate that ppl who get x score on the usa(j)mo get this label of “MOP” slapped on their resume and the a free ticket to happiness and short term success, while those who get x-1 score get none of this. it shouldn’t be such a drastic difference, especially because it’s so easy to just have a bad day on the usa(j)mo. life is so unfair in some ways<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">* but this is just in my opinion - everyone has had different life circumstances and probably has very different views on what the best thing on earth could be.<br>
<br>
for everyone who didn’t make MOP, don’t worry - sometime in your future you’ll come across what you think is the best thing on earth, whether or not it’s MOP, and you will probably experience epiphanies just as powerful. don’t give up and keep going!</span></div>

			<div class="message">ok this next week will be rly rly challenging, because 2 of the 3 AP exams I am very much not ready for this year are in the next week. I’m probably going to be doing the most schoolwork I’ve ever done in a week, by far.<br>
but despite how challenging, I’m still less stressed than the week before the usamo, I guess. because AP exams are different from contests in that if you study a certain amount you can actually ensure that you get better, and will score higher.<br>
ahh this next week will just be a test as to how much self control I can have to not waste time on social media and actually study.. something that has not been looking very good recently..<br>
<br>
I think I caught up on the 2 weeks of school I missed, but my grades are pretty concerning, let’s just say that.<br>
<br>
I think it’s actually beneficial to not overload on AP exams tho because (1) more free time which could be used for more useful things (2) most AP’s don’t translate into college credit anyways (3) saves money. I haven’t taken very many AP tests so far but I kinda wish I am taking less.<br>
<br>
I have like no time to do math rip (well like only the afternoons because I’m often busy in the evenings and have to do schoolwork in the mornings) ahh I really should’ve treasured the days when I had more time to actually do math..<br>
<br>
I also miss reading books for some reason. when I was younger I spent a lot of time reading because we had a lot of books in the house and my parents encouraged me too; now I’m just much too busy, but I think there is value in reading actual texts other than blog posts and discord messages because one can learn more about the world and also become better at writing. English is actually one of my favorite classes rn because <strike>a lot of the others have gotten difficult</strike> we don’t get much homework and actually get to read and analyze stuff.<br>
<br>
however, despite all the AP grind stress, there’s a huge weight taken off my shoulders which is that math contests are basically over this year so there’s nothing huge to stress over for the time being. for the past 6 months there’s always been a storm cloud in the distance: amc or aime or some tst or usamo etc. not having a source of nervousness overshadowing life is kinda freeing (although becoming too carefree has its negative impacts too). I guess I’ll enjoy this freedom for the next few months??<br>
<br>
btw, huge congrats to the IMO team!!! (and for all the people who didn’t make it but got really close, know that ur just as good and tbh there is so much luck involved in selections like these :/)</div>

			<div class="message">ok that was really not real life<br>
no part of it was even near realistic<br>
being at a luxury resort next to the sea only made it feel more out of this world.<br>
pretty much everyone seemed as optimistic and happy as possible (with the exception of some contest performance disappointment which was unnecessary) and pretty much nowhere else can you see such a level of optimism and happiness. there seemed to be no sin or evil - I think it’s been over a week since I’ve really seen a sad or angry person. I will never forget ROU4 smiling at me after both days of the contest, before we were allowed to leave our seats. it was the happiest, most genuine smile I have ever seen. I think that moment captures the mood of the entire trip.<br>
so I’m kinda glad to come back down to earth from that artificial heavenly palace, because something so unnatural can never last long; I’d definitely get spoiled — by happiness or elitism or something — if I were to stay for a little bit longer. I might forget what sadness and sin are, and then fail to live my normal life again. so I think it is about time that the wonderful experience ends.<br>
<br>
despite being slightly more enjoyable of an experience (due to having more social skills, being slightly less incompetent, and also knowing more ppl), I think egmo this year had less of an impact on me than last year. this year it just flew by really really quickly because I pretty much knew what was going to happen; it wasn’t really slowed down by surprises and suspense like last time, and I didn’t leave having felt an eye-opening, life-changing experience like last time. I wasn’t constantly nervous, and I guess the entire thing just felt like a lot of <i>fun</i>, every moment of it. although a lot of the people were different, the atmosphere was already familiar. at least in my opinion, the more something happens, it has less of an impact on me each time. but it was still really really exciting, and a wonderful opportunity, because the more familiar one is with something, the more one can get out of it, by optimizing which opportunities to take.<br>
<br>
I’ve also been spoiled with in-person interaction for the past, like, month — basically every weekend there’s been a math comp of some sort at which I’ve been able to see ppl I actually nontrivially relate with (which doesn’t normally happen on a daily basis). it’s just easier to empathize with people in-person, and you understand them on another level after being around them in-person for long enough. so I guess I’ve gotten used to not being lonely. and now that I’m back at home, ive got to to learn how to deal with loneliness again, cuz for the vast majority of the year I will not be able to regularly see my friends in-person. I’m probably going to end up being on discord 24/7 after May 3rd/4th (which are 2 of the AP exams I am most scared for) as an attempt to get as much socialization as I can. but online is still nowhere near in-person.<br>
now I know how important in-person interaction is.</div>

			<div class="message">cuz I’m definitely paying attention to the presentation that is happening right now and have like nothing better to do :skull:<br>
<br>
so we failed to buy a Big Mac rip :skull: there was like no free time in Ljubljana (the capital) today, and there are no McDonald’s in the small town our hotel is in lol<br>
I guess the USA will not have a mascot this year lol<br>
so oh well, maybe next year<br>
we did go touring in Ljubljana and played laser tag tho <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> (and apparently I’m very bad at games involving aiming guns..)<br>
and I technically got 8.5 hours of sleep despite sleeping at midnight and waking up at 6 because bus ride was long <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
we also did play tractor with the one member of china team who knows how to play <strike>and I spoke more actual chinese than I have in like a month, while also embarrassing myself</strike><br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">some comments on the problems because we are allowed to discuss now</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">so basically the overall difficulty was much easier than normal lol<br>
in my opinion, 2&lt;1&lt;3&lt;6&lt;4&lt;5<br>
but like say 2 was overall harder than day 1 :thinking:<br>
day 1 went pretty smoothly - I spent like 10 minutes on p2, then 10 minutes on p1, 15 minutes on p3, wrote them up, and then wasted time by doing origami (I made a dodecahedron and some stars with scratch paper) and attempting to sleep; didn’t quite realize leaving early was a thing lmao<br>
so it turned out A LOT of ppl swept day 1 lol<br>
day 2 was a bit more rough.. I solved p6 in like 15 minutes (I always do the geo first oops), then p4 in like 20 minutes, and then THOUGHT I solved p5 in like 20 minutes but after writing up some of it realized it was a fakesolve. because I’m bad at NT I spent like another 1.5 hours flailing on it oops<br>
and eventually I found a kinda bashy solution involving working backwards to like find what type of numbers could possibly occur in the sequence<br>
so yeah not the nice solution everyone else found..<br>
anyways thankfully I didn’t fakesolve; fakesolving NT is too easy oops<br>
<br>
I kinda got very lucky with the all combo and geo distrib tbh; p5 was a very combo-y NT<br>
what’s with everything being combo and geo this year? :0</div><br>
<br>
random comment: everyone at the EGMO has a lot of personality. like practically all the contestants - they don’t come across as the stereotypical math nerd that we Americans think of. I guess European math nerds are just built different?? almost everyone here could practically pass off as a normal person with like social skills and other skills besides math, and it’s really inspirational.</div>

			<div class="message">ok idek where to start so this is just a random list of things that have happened or will happen
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>both contest days have happened. no comment about difficulty or how we did because official discussion is not allowed until 6pm Eastern today (so actually in an hour)</li>
<li>socialized with some other teams but I socialized the most with my own team (for obvious reasons lol), they taught me tractor and poker and now we are like addicted to these games. we also met a lot of other teams which was really cool! we kinda talked with the China team (or more like Isabella did cuz she’s the best at Chinese). very interesting to be able to observe really orz people. some of them actually come across as mortal human beings.</li>
<li>we are planning to buy big macs in the capital city when we go tomorrow (there’s no McDonald’s in the small city we are in) because we need something to represent America at the closing ceremony. all the other countries have mascots and stuff and a Big Mac would be the perfect American mascot! also we want to get cowboy hats next year but unfortunately it’s too late this year.</li>
<li>the hotel the contest is at is right next to the Adriatic Sea; it’s really pretty (I have sent pics in various places)</li>
<li>now that the contest is over, we can fool around as much as we want.. I mean what.. we’ve been studying the previous 2 nights but that will probably stop now. my team is gonna stay up until midnight today (or try to) to post the problems on aops, which is gonna be pretty hard since I woke up at 4 oops. still haven’t played tractor with the China team cuz apparently only one of them knows how to play lol.</li>
<li>trying very hard to stay up until midnight right now; one hour to go</li>
<li>I really hope I don’t lose points for bad writeups but that might happen lmao</li>
</ul>
also, apparently a lot of stuff happened at home in the 1+eps weeks that I’ve been away??
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>my grandfather moved back to LA</li>
<li>my sister got sick and then recovered?</li>
<li>my sister and parents went to Berkeley Mini Math Tournament and had a lot of fun</li>
<li>my brother got badly injured after falling off his bike and is alone at home for a few days because of above bullet point</li>
</ul>
literally more than has ever happened at home in a week lmao<br>
<br>
I haven’t done any schoolwork at all on this trip and am really not looking forward to catching up when I get back!!<br>
<br>
but anyway I’ll try to enjoy the last few days as much as possible!!</div>

			<div class="message">I’m kinda tired of being incompetent, at a lot of stuff, including math skill, height, tractor, chinese speaking skill, etc. I try not to show it, and cover it all up with confidence, but deep down inside, I know I am incompetent.<br>
<br>
I just want to not fail the EGMO. I know it doesn’t mean much, but I don’t want to drag the team down, or to reveal my incompetence, but deep down inside, I know I will, because math is hard and all of my team members are so cracked lol. (and so is the china team and a lot of other ppl).<br>
I just want to be able to enjoy the last part of my vacation from school as much as I have so far, and not be depressed. I want to partake in all the crazy things my team and I are joking about (like going swimming, staying up until 2am playing tractor with the china team (yes we are actually gonna try and do this), and just being absolutely stupid), but my incompetence might block this from happening.<br>
<br>
anyway, I will continue to try. and maybe if I work hard enough, someday I will not be incompetent anymore.<br>

			<div class="message">like how it’s important to generally want to do good things for other ppl<br>
this is why my parents are religious; because they believe that bible stories teach good life lessons. whether they actually happened is kinda irrelevant to them, but the big idea is to value supporting other ppl over simply helping oneself, which is what Jesus did.<br>
when I was a kid, it was always more important to be nice than smart; if I misbehaved or smth then I would be told not to do math for a while because “the worst thing is to have smarts and do bad things with it”<br>
my parents are constantly ranting about how the math community is full of un-caring ppl, because ppl are too focused on their own goals to give much consideration for each other. in a hyper-competitive environment, it’s fundamentally tough to be caring because you are literally competing against your best friends. but doing math doesn’t have to be all about the competitiveness.<br>
<br>
the thing that surprised me the most when I joined OTIS was how caring everyone was. this is probably my favorite aspect of the OTIS community, and to an even greater extent the MOP community. coming from a place like CNCM which was basically an orzculture battleground where spammy middle schoolers borderline-harassed each other for fun <span class="bbfont-three-q">(ok that may be a bit of an exaggeration)</span>, it was really surprising to see people actually using heart emotes unironically, to show that they actually cared about each other. I had never seen this level of genuine support in a math community before, and was gladly amazed that it existed. it’s actually even more so nowadays, where you will see a whole chain of blobheart emotes upon opening #social-threads. I think being supportive of others, and likewise having others available when you need support, is crucial to succeeding in a hyper competitive environment like the comp math world. cuz there’s no point winning if you’re unlikeable, and there’s no point being really good at math if you’re not going to use ur skills to eventually do something good for humanity.<br>
so keep caring about ppl <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley">))<br>
<br>
I typed this while on the plane to Germany cuz sleeping is hard <span class="bbfont-three-q">and I was definitely not staring at the green light which was actually the bathroom sign in the distance</span>.. I got a solid 2 hours of sleep <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> (then I fell asleep for an hour at a table just now lol)</div>

			<div class="message">it’s not even junioritis, it’s just sadness<br>
<br>
SMT happened yesterday and I think it was my last college comp of junior year. which means that the next time I go to a college comp (which won’t happen until November?? idek), I’ll be a senior and <i>actually</i> retired. I didn’t do super well, in fact I did very mediocre. I’ve spent many years trying to reach the level of being able to consistently do well, and it’s never worked - my life continues to be based on luck :p<br>
<br>
anyway, now that I’m kinda semi retired, I don’t really know what I do math for anymore. for the next year, I’ll probably just be doing math for the fun of it, or to “relive the memories”. who needs a practical purpose? and probably my goal from now on will be to make my math career last as long as possible.<br>
<br>
but eventually, we’re all going to have to let go. so many ppl around me (basically class of 2024) are already letting go aka becoming depressed because how can you let go of something that’s been home for so long? it’s hard to not become depressed when so many ppl around you are, but I’m trying very hard<br>
<br>
however, y’all don’t deserve to be depressed. letting go of math comps is just a rite of passage I guess; there <i>has</i> to be something to life beyond math comps, anyways. and basically no one is going to achieve their highest goals in the few years they have to do math comps. not everyone has to make mop; there are just way too few mop spots for that to happen. in the long run, how much does your performance on high school math comps really affect your career? is there really any difference between usamo and mop? probably the only thing it would affect, if at all, is college, and in 10 years no one will care at all anymore. so please stop beating yourself up over it. stop thinking you’re a failure because you lost the game of luck.<br>
<br>
<br>
so much has happened in the past 2 days, it feels like it’s been 2 months. and it feels like I’ve aged so much. 2022 feels like a fantasy that was forever ago.<br>
and I don’t want y’all to be depressed.</div>

 on discrete :skull: tbh on contests I just pop off sometimes and do mediocre or sub-mediocre most of the time<br>
was not expecting the difficulty tbh, or the trolliness of a lot of problems (divided by 1 moment) (sqrt 1 moment) maybe I should've practiced some past problems lmaooo<br>
we did not do too well on team either lmao<br>
oh btw I was on team Individuals 156 with JL, LZ, BC, ML, and another VL xD<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">rough overview because tbh the real treasure was the friends we made along the way</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">so I got dropped off at like 8 and said hi to ppl, eventually found my team<br>
we went into the div A waiting room and saw lots of 1434's on the board and CR gave me the <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">rectangles and squares problem</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">a mathcamp joke?</div> (which I failed to solve for the entire contest)<br>
then we found our room and took individual tests which were clearly brutal (but some of my teammates did well, hi JL)<br>
then team round in which I spent most of the time on #2 smh (ended up barybashing and getting an answer involving sqrt(1) and being completely sure I sillied)<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">what is this monotone difficulty curve</span><br>
at lunch I found some other teams, talked with lehigh valley for a bit (who slayed as expected), then decided to find the MAST meetup and TJ<br>
I found the MAST meetup and hung out there for a few minutes. I met AT, JX, IC, OY (who I had met the previous day too) and also AC, carolynlikesmath's brother! carolynlikesmath is so cool. Then I found my team again playing cards in Frist, and LZ (who was also looking for the TJ team) happened to be there, so we both found TJ eventually<br>
I didn't get a chance to actually talk to TZ despite seeing him many times throughout the competition rip.<br>
It happens that one member of the TJ team, VT, is best friends with my sister so they decided to do a very long (2.5 hr) video call on my phone. There was bad wifi inside so we went outside; I decided to work on a math problem that was in my head from yesterday and made like 0 progress on it and eventually we decided to randomly walk around princeton campus. We got a lot of strange looks from ppl because VT and my sister were having a very strange and interesting conversation as usual. Eventually the call ended because my phone was low on battery and we found some members of my team, plus ST, CR, RN. We talked about anti problems for a bit and I failed some more on the rectangles and squares problem.<br>
<br>
We then went to dinner at a restaurant suggested by CR’s sister and during that time the sky turned very dark very quickly and we got the tornado warning. We hid in the restaurant for a bit but eventually decided to run to awards ceremony in the rain, which wasn’t actually <i>too</i> bad. It was kinda hard to find awards tho but we eventually found it with the help of AW. While waiting for awards, me and <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">VT</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">the original creator of the anti-geo parody lmao</div> decided to sing the pro-geo version of a million dreams in response to AW singing the anti-geo version (smh). Then awards happened and lots of ppl slayed, including TJ, lehigh valley, CT17, and <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">IZ!!!!!</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">who literally won the whole contest orz orz orz</div> (everyone join IZF) (oh and congrats to TZ for winning div B!)<br>
Finally, I saw the daily challenge instructors AH, SK, AG, and ofc VT and LW but they had to leave early lol</div><br>
on the day after I walked around Princeton with my dad and also went to MEME which was <strike>a meme</strike> actually very very well organized so props to the OMMC staff. Basically everyone was in middle or elem school but im sure they had a lot of fun. Squareman gave a very orz speech at the beginning. They are lowkey such a great organization.<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">unrelated</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">This month will be absolutely hectic because I have to get as much schoolwork done in these next 3 days as possible (plus trying to do math too) and then SMT and EGMO and then grind grind grind for AP’s (im just gonna end up studying for them in the order that they occur or smth) which will be absolute pain <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

			<div class="message">in some ways, the end of hs is a lot like elementary school.<br>
there aren’t that many ppl doing math anymore. in elem school there weren’t very many kids in the math community seriously doing math (because those who did were basically those whose parents knew what resources existed) and not many juniors in highschool do math seriously anymore either, because a lot have burned out or found other interests or are too busy with school.<br>
middle school is kind of like the peak of math competitiveness. there are the most middle schoolers who actually do math seriously, a combination of peer pressure and the fact that you usually don’t get TOO much homework in middle school, and so ppl are actually able to grind math for 8 hours a day (whether they actually enjoy it is a different topic.) I was kinda average at math in middle school, at least compared to my peers, because there were just so many math sweats everywhere you look. but tbh it was kinda fun having ppl around you who are actually doing the same type of math as you, because way more potential to make friends. I think I’ve done about the same amount of math, more or less, since like 4th grade, but I know tons and tons of ppl who did like 4x as much as me in middle school and 0x as much now.<br>
in middle school I actually had irl friends who lived in my city who did math, which was not true in elem school nor is it now. I guess you could say I had the most of an irl social life in middle school. but literally 100% of those friends have burned out now, which is really really sad<br>
it kinda feels like things are coming full circle. I’m not that one weird 4th grader in the city who does math mostly because of parents, I’m an 11th grader who does math not at all because of parents, but just as alone* as I was in 4th grade.<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">*I am actually very much not alone because of online friends &lt;3 that was only referring to irl<br>
<span style="color:transparent">&lt;3</span></span><br>
also, post-USAMO laziness is hitting REALLY hard T_T this just means I’ll be even more busy in April…<br>
for example, rip my sleep schedule, I’ve been staying up late checking otis discord and sleeping at 10:30-11 for many days in a row :skull: and hence waking up after 6. and also I SHOULD be studying for egmo :skull:<br>
idk if I’ve done this little math since the beginning of 9th grade :skull:<br>
<br>
tbh I think there might come a time in the next year or so when my main motivation to do math is to inspire my sister to do math, idk, I think I’m the only one in the family (and outside I guess) who she really sees doing math and I only have one more year at home so it’s kind of my duty to do that <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

and somehow there were no NT diophantines or ineqs?<br>
I’m literally shocked<br>
this year’s test was fr sooo much different than last year<br>
to all the ppl who are good at NT and alg, I aspire to be like you and am really sorry this test was so sub-optimal subject wise.<br>

you should obsessively check your march madness bracket instead!!!<br>
if you want to rid your worry about jmo/amo scores on Thursday and friday, go watch the games at <a href="https://ncaa.com/march-madness-live" class="bbcode_url" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ncaa.com</a> instead! Also pray that your bracket won't get screwed over by an upset!<br>

			<div class="message">well, this is it, possibly the penultimate moment in my math career. a nice little reminder that nothing gold can stay, because regardless of what happened in the past, much of it could pretty much just dissolve in the next few days.<br>
<br>
I’m kinda tired of stressing about contests. the last time my life was more or less stress-free was like last summer, or at least before the amc season. (or I guess to completely escape stress you’d have to go way back into childhood) since then it’s just been overshadowed by contests, and in particular MAA contests. I guess that’s just what life is; the stress is just gonna always exist whether it’s about math contests or not. so maybe I should give up on wishing the stress would go away..<br>
so after usamo i’ll either be like, insanely happy and more or less stress-free and pretty much just satisfied, or… ok let’s not think about it<br>
it must be nice actually having brain cells and not having ur life on the line every time there’s an MAA contest <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
my <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">mental health hasn’t been the best recently</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I think this is true for a lot of ppl :/</div>, probably for obvious reasons, but there are some things that do make me happy. in particular teaching. I pretty much always look happy when teaching, and that’s probably cuz I genuinely am. (or maybe it’s just social interaction, like talking to real interesting ppl not just classmates at school - tbh staying at home and <strike>grinding math</strike> (not) can get lonely sometimes and maybe I just crave social interaction.) but tbh I actually do enjoy teaching, and running office hours at Athemath, etc, a LOT, and that’s one of the things keeping me mentally stable. idk if it’s the action of helping ppl or doing fun math problems or just literally talking with ppl, but it can make my day no matter what.<br>
<br>
I just wanna graduate from math contests happy, I guess<br>
<br>
this post gives such senioritis vibes and… I hate it<br>

			<div class="message">ive never dreaded something this much<br>
well I dreaded the AIME almost as much, but this has an even more drastic impact... basically it will determine whether or not I'm depressed during the <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">summer</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">or I guess June</div>, and whether or not I'll be able to see my friends again during that time. it really, REALLY doesn't help that I literally live in the same city as math olympiad program, because if I don't make it then for that entire month the fact that I didn't make it will be rubbed in...* and given that I've made it the past 2 years, literally <i>everyone</i> will be disappointed/surprised. this is just something one cannot deny, no matter how sad or unfortunate it is, so please don't try to say otherwise.<br>
so there kind of isn't an option for me to not make it, yet there's a solid 50% chance or higher that I won't, and thus makes quite a quandary.<br>
<br>
* = this has been true for the past 2 years too, and so I've convinced myself that I absolutely have to make it for those 2 years. and I guess those times I actually tried really hard, but this year I'm just high or something (junioritis???) and am not really trying and so now I'm <i>actually</i> screwed<br>
<br>
so yeah I'm basically just really really really dreading next week. either god will have mercy on me or I'll be battling some monster for 9 ish hours like what happens at the end of every harry potter book, except I won't win and voldemort will take the soul out of me.<br>
don't get me wrong, I love math and I love competitions (ESPECIALLY in-person ones).. but just this one particular contest, is way too nerve-wracking to be fun. kinda like the egmo tst's I guess.<br>
I think im slowly losing my sanity...<br>
<br>
also listening to music helps evoke emotions again !<br>
<br>
also please don't say "it's okay if you don't make it" because unfortunately that is just not true &gt;_&lt;<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">and also please don't say "you will make it" because that is also not true &gt;___&lt;</span><br>
clarification: I will not fr be offended if u say these xD</div>

<br>
anyway the title is for several reasons...<br>
<br>
first of all, I crashed my parents' car on the way to school today. half a year into learning how to drive and i've already crashed it!!1<br>
(I already ranted about this in otis emotional-support which fr is a good source of emotional support)<br>
it was completely my fault but basically the road was icy and I was going a bit too fast and tried to brake and couldn't and as a result I scraped the tesla that was driving in front of us on the corner of its back bumper and the corner of our front bumper got damaged quite a bit more... so rip my insurance (and possibly my parents') :skull: :skull: :skull:<br>
everyone was ok, (fortunately, cuz if my reaction was a second slower we would've crashed on and I could've injured my family), but the cars were not<br>
I think I have been scarred for life...<br>
<br>
second of all, the usamo.<br>
im not looking forward to being done with my math career<br>
not looking forward to not qualifying for mop... one more week left to live in the ignorant bliss that I must, must, <i>must</i> make mop and that it <i>will happen because I want it to</i> ok but tbh I <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">don't deserve it at all</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">anyone notice how not-hard I've been working this past year <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
(compared to other ppl who are clearly working much, much harder)<br>
<br>
also ive had like way too much luck in my lifetime so like it's bound to run out at <i>some</i> point</div><br>
yeah im actually kinda screwed...<br>
alright enough on that topic for now<br>
<br>
thirdly, school... its the last week before <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">spring break</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">during which I first have to experience death, then have to ACTUALLY cram ap cs, oh and also do all the egmo problems</div> and I somehow have 5237582 things to do, not even homework, mostly related to a stem magazine club im running in which I must re-learn how to do bibliographies on overleaf and do like 20 of them in the next 1 day<br>
and I also have to somehow prepare for 4 AP exams and make up for 10 days of school I will miss in April by completing a lot of assignments ahead of time and doing a lot of AP studying and cramming on my own - REALLY looking forward to that.<br>
fr tho these next 2 months will be a whirlwind<br>
<br>
ive been experiencing a lack of emotions recently. maybe its a result of high stress or just a lot of things going on or maybe its related to me not listening to much music recently (which is also directly correlated with going to bed and waking up late) rip. kinda miss listening to music...<br>
<br>
so the lack of blog posts recently is probably due to this lack of emotions :flushed:</div>

			<div class="message">oops these recent posts REALLY have been high quality huh (not)<br>
well part of the reason why I’m not posting as much is because I’m feeling quite unproductive and somehow have less motivation to post when unproductive oops lmao<br>
but yeah need more work ethic oops<br>
also I’m kinda screwed for APs. I’m taking AP Physics C E&amp;M and we ONLY JUST STARTED the E&amp;M, I think we’re a few months late lol. It might also have to do with the fact that our old physics teacher randomly left in late January and then there was a month during which we had like no physics teacher. anyway at least I’m taking physics exam on the later date so I guess this is what I will spend first half of May on..<br>
also have to study for AP Macroeconomics and AP CS ;-; and also Lang I guess but that one’s like nothing compared to the others cuz it’s much more skills than memorization. speaking of Lang it’s a pretty cool class learning how to formulate arguments and stuff.<br>
speaking of school, no school tomorrow cuz parent teacher conferences (oops this also means my parents will see my report card on which I have all A’s except for a B+ in biology not even AP, oops why am I so bad at biology)<br>
<br>
so yeah idk life is just hectic and crazy<br>
maybe someday I’ll have time to reflect and actually write a proper blog post lol<br>
<br>
cmimc in 2 weeks yeee (and we do not talk about what’s in 12 days)<br>
my whole team got accepted to pumac as individuals lolll tbh just very glad we even get the chance to go tho, very excited <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">kinda late, but I went to girls in math at yale last weekend ! it was a very chill competition with not very many contestants, but still very fun !!<br>
was on a team with <b>laura.yingyue.zhang</b>, <b>angie.</b>, <b>mcl_7241</b>, <b>mathsmiley</b>, Pritika (forgot aops oops)<br>
it was very nice to meet ppl !! I also met a lot of other daily challenge instructors <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> all of the students there seemed really friendly and talkative for some reason, even more so than any other math comp ive been to...<br>
there was also a "countdown round" which was very interesting :thinking: middle school nostalgia...<br>
<br>
uh im being way less productive than I should be these days.. im actually unironically losing work ethic over time...<br>
<br>
yay its march!<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">!</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">thats prob not a good thing tho..</div> very excited for things coming up including cmimc, <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">pumac</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">hopefully I actually get a team :skull: waitlist :skull:</div><br>
winter is arguably the most depressing time of year so quite glad that it's march<br>
now time to die to school and nervousness about certain oly's!!!<br>
why is time actually passing so fast tho<br>
<br>
there is very little to do in school today bc a lot of my classmates are taking the SAT, so I pretty much get to do whatever I want for the rest of the morning :relieved: :relieved: not looking forward to actually studying for and taking the SAT later this year...</div>

			<div class="message">but possibly the best, months of my childhood <i>edit from me right before the usamo: I don’t think the past month was one of the best months of childhood..</i><br>
maybe not life because that would be too broad a statement, but childhood definitely<br>
stressful because certain math olys to prepare for; this is likely the penultimate moment of my math career so kinda gotta end somewhat strong.. and also AP’s exist<br>
I’m gonna actually have to stop slacking off in school soon and that kinda sucks<br>
but best because these <i>are</i> the penultimate months so there is a lot at stake, and a lot of reason to keep going<br>
and lots of irl meetups to look forward to <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
free time is diminishing at a concerning rate.. guess I’ll have to become more efficient or smth<br>
in particular bc of this science magazine thing im running at school that I have to put together, and other schoolwork, and bc apparently im going to become director of athemath soon<br>
also I pushed a lot of stuff to spring break (such as self studying for AP CS and I guess preparing a ton for a certain oly) so hopefully I will be still alive then<br>
but anyway wheeee</div>

yeah that last post was pretty cringe<br>
<br>
I’ve become a lot more social recently and so I actually really wish I could go to hmmt lol, not bc of the math aspect but to see ppl XD<br>
<br>
using insta less really does make me more productive, wow what a surprise<br>
so many ppl are on the grind; should also be on the grind myself :melting_face: but like props to ppl who have actually figured out how to grind (and have the self control to); I admire you<br>
<br>
have fun at hmmt yall! im actually looking forward to late March-April soooo much except that one huge boulder lies in the way: AMO</div>

			<div class="message">yet part of me kinda needs it.<br>
what do ppl generally get confidence from? I think the main major sources of confidence that ppl have are physical (appearance), mental (skills), and the kind that come from relationships - emotional affirmation from others that they are worth something. I think a lot of ppl in the world get a large portion of their confidence from their physical selves though, especially young people. it’s the easiest type of confidence to get, just simply look a certain way and people immediately respect you a lot more. it’s the brutal reality, that I hate to acknowledge - but everyone’s first impression of you is going to be largely based on your physical appearance, and first impressions are quite powerful. many people will have a view of you no deeper than a first impression, and I guess it depends what you want to do in life but in some cases it might be helpful to interact with people you do not “know”.<br>
<br>
changing your physical self is relatively not hard, at least a thousand times easier than achieving some high math goal or something. and so a lot of ppl see physical confidence as the way out, and I’m not excluding myself from that group. I think I’ve used physical confidence before when I didn’t have much of the better type which really was a skill issue. I still don’t have that much mental confidence, and still have a math skill issue, so that is why I kinda need physical confidence. (and have by the way succeeded in getting a lot more of it in the past 1-2 years). the thing about mental confidence though is that it can appear/dissipate rather quickly with realization or change in mental perspective.<br>
so in some ways, having some nonzero intake of social media can actually be beneficial, in that it can supply one type of confidence. hence why I haven’t deleted insta yet..<br>
<br>
but of course, there are much much better types of confidence, such as the mental affirmation that one gets after becoming good at math, or something else. being skilled on the inside is much deeper and more impactful than on the outside.<br>
but however you achieve it, confidence is really really important. too little can lead to depression and self harm, an adequate amount of it is somewhat indispensable, and enough of it can give one the feeling that you are self-sustainable, and don’t need to lean on anyone for support. and this freedom is one of the best feelings in the world.<br>
<br>
anyways I really need to stop spending unnecessary time on insta, because it is innately kinda a big waste of time, and is causing my math skill to decrease, hence my mental confidence to decrease.. not good. it makes one lonely too tbh, scrolling through posts and things, compared to like discord on which you can actually interact with real people. having real conversations with real people, and building relationships, is actually so important..<br>
<br>
so have confidence y’all! you all are math geniuses, and thus are entitled to the best and hardest to achieve type of confidence, which comes straight from your skill, and rather than just being a shallow layer on the outside, it can power you for life.</div>

			<div class="message">they dont rly care what scores I get and never really pushed me to do math (<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">well after elementary school, that is</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">they were much more strict when I was in elementary school lol, but this I am kinda grateful for because it taught me to have <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">work ethic</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">which I need more of right now</div> and to like math and stuff</div>)<br>
after that they basically just let me do whatever I wanted math-wise<br>
so they didnt rly teach me any math past like aime qual level, but they did inspire me by just existing and having the personalities and careers that they have<br>
I honestly have a hard time thinking of any major flaws my parents have<br>
they are both really, really optimistic people who literally never have moments of self-doubt or mental breakdown even tho they work really really hard<br>
and I haven’t seen them ever really be mad at anything or anyone except my siblings and I when we misbehaved<br>
sometimes I wonder how its possible to be this optimistic. most ppl at least have some things in life to resent about. but my parents seem to just be happy 24/7 somehow<br>
I don’t think I should ever complain about my parents anymore lol - I’m very lucky to have supportive parents like them when 99% of asian parents are very much not like this<br>
and im very sorry for all of yall with strict parents who force u to do things u don’t want to… hope that someday you’ll find your freedom<br>
also, my parents are not on wechat, and are second generation, so theyre kinda like a cross between american and immigrant parents maybe this is why they are kinda lenient… literally my paternal grandparents are MUCH more strict than my parents<br>
I wish I was as optimistic as my parents tbh<br>
<br>
<br>
ok I actually need to get good at math now because China, Taiwan, and Japan are going to the egmo :eyes: :skull:<br>
<br>
gl to ppl on the aime ii today lol</div>

rip imagine going to hmmt feb tho; I kinda regret the decision to go to hmmt nov but oh well<br>
<br>
I went to mc chapter last weekend to "help out" and basically just walked back and forth delivering papers<br>
wow, mc chapter is <i>so insanely organized</i> compared to like highschool/college run comps; not like the latter are bad tho; I kinda prefer the latter because the organizers actually know math and are rly, rly interesting ppl <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
mathcounts brings back a lot of nostalgia <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> it's crazy to think that today's middle schoolers have not been to a single in person mathcounts chapter competition tho<br>
irl &gt;&gt;<br>
there's like always that cult of smart middle school math kids who hangs out with each other during the competition and back in middle school I actually had irl friends because there were actually other ppl my age in my city who did math; now they've basically all quit <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> the good old days <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

if I actually made egmo then that’s an excuse to force myself to do nongeo tho I guess<br>

			<div class="message">though I'm far more concerned about the second than the first, I really need to qual red this year<br>
<br>
things i need to do before march 21:<br>
<br>
-get at least like 6-7 otis units done, will probably be mostly geo and nt since those are my weak subjects<br>
-ideally get to 200 isl solves (currently 141)<br>
-finish 2000-present AMO 1/4/2/5 (doing amo because I ran out of jmo problems a while ago)<br>
-do oly mocks as they come up on aops mock contests and not fail them lol<br>
<br>
by the way, if you know any suggest past jmo mocks on aops mocks?<br>
<br>
also, about t-7 and t-49, i saw those and my thought process in my head was like, oh 49 = 7^2 and<br>
<br>
this is one of the 2 days in which (days until jmo) = (days until aime)^2, the other one is feburary 13 technically if you allow negative days<br>
<br>
although this is only possible because the difference between jmo day 1 and aime day is 42 days, which is twice a triangular number<br>
<br>
why do i think of all this after noticing 7 days until aime and 49 days until jmo lol</div>

honestly I thought I had no chance after flopping dectst so this feels like an <i>absolute miracle</i> istg I have gotten so insanely lucky in life...<br>

			<div class="message">basically my whole life, math comps have been my sole source of self esteem and happiness. how well I did on a math contest basically defined how happy I would be for the next few weeks or months. I think I’m finally breaking out of this bubble. younger me would say that I’m getting weaker, and maybe I am. I’m not done with junior year yet, so maybe it’s too early to think this. <i>perhaps I should be doing math instead of daydreaming.</i><br>
<br>
but looking back on the past 5+ years, it was not the contest scores, but the relationships that mattered. (and of course solving cool math problems, too.) I will never forget the countless math comps during which I walked around, asking random people <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">“what’s your AoPS?”</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">notably mc nats, bmmt, lmt, etc.</div>-- many of whom I am still good friends with today. those are some of the most memorable moments from my whole math career. these interactions with such amazing people greatly humbled me and served as a source of inspiration. it wasn’t making mop or anything prestigious that enabled me to make observations like these. in fact, idk what making mop really did other than serving as an entry ticket to another round of contests and a little elite social club, and of course a boost of self esteem. but I don't think it's made much of a difference in the long run.<br>
<br>
I don’t think I’ll ever be “depressed” that I didn’t do well on a math contest again. maybe somewhat sad, but there aren’t that many things left which are contingent upon whether or not I do well. so much has already been decided. in particular, socially speaking I’ll be in about the same place no matter what; it’s not like all of my friends will disappear if I do badly. there’s still a lot of stress, because it would be very nice to not fail the upcoming math contests and actually have a chance to see ppl, but there’s no longer the nagging feeling of life or death.</div>

			<div class="message">despite how massively sad, I think it’s good that &lt;days of sun&gt; are interspersed so sparsely. I think if they happened too frequently, I wouldn’t appreciate each one so much— and, it would be an unhealthy dose of happiness, like downing too much sugar in one go. it would also be extremely distracting to my regular life of consuming olympiad problems. but I really, really do appreciate every day of sun, because tbh it is such a huge amount of motivation.<br>
<br>
well, 62 days till the next day of sun. this one will not be in la la land, but in a place much drearier and colder and more familiar, but it will still be la la land figuratively. between now and then, lots of hurdles to overcome which could result in some near-death experiences with monsters such as aime and amo, but it will come—<br>

			<div class="message">hence why I’m so bad at math /j<br>
I have a hard time focusing at home during daylight hours - there are just so many things to daydream and think about that it’s so hard to focus on the actual math problem, ESPECIALLY if it’s nongeo<br>
eventually my wandering thoughts might go in the direction of what I want my future to look like which brings me back to the topic of math contests and then I realize again that I need to start grinding immediately and so I pick up the pencil again<br>
once I have actually picked up the pencil, ideas come quite quickly to me, but the hard part is actually picking up the pencil, and then trying not to drop it again<br>
listening to music really helps because it’s something I can focus on while thinking and at least I’m not thinking about 20 billion other things at once, so listening to music actually helps me focus<br>
these days I have been bingeing listening to music at school with earbuds and trying to do math… I get like 90% of my math done either in the early morning or at school lmao<br>
I wish I didn’t look so antisocial at school — I probably look like a complete weirdo who is tuning out everything that’s happening around them, which I pretty much am — but it’s sadly the best way to be productive…<br>
<br>
ofc I don’t daydream during actual oly because there’s way too much pressure distracting me, but just sitting at home doing math I find it so hard to actually focus on the problem, and this seems like an issue<br>
<br>
anyway, death in 5 days<br>
at least then it’ll be over and I’ll be in the afterlife and I’ll be able to safely say that it didn’t happen instead of having to worry about the possibility that it might, depending on my actions, happen, bc it’s just so overwhelming sometimes thinking that if I was to do something different right now it might make a massive impact<br>
and the afterlife will be pretty nice honestly, especially the 9th day of it <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
…<br>
<br>
I really miss being a young child. there was a time when I was a young child (elem school) and then there was a time when I tried to pass off as a young child despite not exactly being one (middle and early high school), but now I have to accept the fact that I simply am not one and cannot really pretend to be one any longer.<br>
although there were some aspects of childhood that I really, really do not want to go back to (such as parental strictness), I miss the strength of the relationships I had. there were a few really, really strong relationships, mostly with family, and they’ve faded over the years and I don’t know if I’ll ever have relationships that strong again. I feel like half of my relationships nowadays are extremely weak (basically the irl ones) and the other half are artificial (because they’re online and the online world literally feels so fake sometimes).<br>
and of course, I miss the feeling of no one expecting anything out of you, and not having to by any means know what you’re doing. the entirety of winter break I got to sit in the backseat of the car because I’m not legally allowed to drive in any state but PA and it was so amazing, partly because I didn’t have to worry about crashing the car and partly because I didn’t have to worry about not knowing where I was going : P<br>
anyway, these things are only going to continue as time goes on and so maybe, maybe, I should just focus on the present…</div>

			<div class="message">I think the last time I <i>really wanted</i> something with a cost to it was December 2020, when I wished my parents would buy me OTIS or WOOT (I had no clue how different they were at the time), both of which I ultimately got in 2021. since then, it’s been experiences and accomplishments that I desire rather than material things. I guess this is just a part of growing up - there was a time when I cared about material things, when I was maybe 8 or 9 years old. I would collect random objects (most of them random pretty things I found), hoping that they would have a use someday, and getting joy from the very act of possessing them. eventually the number of such objects I had decreased because I found that most if not all of them did not actually have any use, and so they slowly went to the trash or into the hands of other material-seeking young children.<br>
giving gifts has never been much of a tradition in my family. my parents never cared to do the whole Santa thing and instead just told us plainly that it was a myth. and when we did get presents, they would make sure that we didn’t spend <i>too</i> much time admiring them, else we might get too materialistic. when my parents gave gifts, they were always meaningful things such as books or practical crafts to build.<br>
this christmas there was not a single gift exchanged within my immediate family. but the fact that we were all together in LA was itself much bigger of a gift than anything material.<br>
I don’t know what my sister thinks of this, of not getting presents like the other kids. she is currently at the material age, treating a feather from the beach like a treasure and collecting tons of seashells to bring back to her classmates and make all of their days. I remember being sad one christmas because I didn’t get any gifts or something. maybe my sister feels that way this year too. I guess gifts mean a lot to small children - would be sad if Santa forgot you or something.<br>
I kind of want to give my sister gifts and make her happy, to give her just a small taste of the childhood that her classmates are enjoying, with presents and fun and games and not having the life of a total nerd. when she was younger I was always getting in trouble for <i>spoiling</i> my sister, and when she misbehaved it was often my fault for <i>spoiling</i> her too much. I honestly can’t bear to watch people go through pain, even if it makes them better in the long term. I kind of don’t want her to have the somewhat sad childhood that my brother and I had (well, sad compared to nowadays - year after year life has been getting progressively better <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley">) but at the same time I know there was something about that upbringing which impacted us very positively.<br>
anyways, I'm usually like the only one in our family who actually gives my sister gifts. it’s possible to succeed while leading an at-least-somewhat-normal life, right? my parents have been getting less strict over time so I guess my sister isn’t <i>quite</i> as much of a nerd than my brother and I were. second-hand happiness feels good. : )</div>

moved into grandparents house which is where we will be staying for the remainder of the break<br>
very little free time since helping family with stuff and attempting to socialize<br>
also have been getting way too much sleep :p<br>
no time to write blogposts because there are many things I should be doing instead of writing blogposts &gt;_&lt;<br>
finding time is hard<br>
so yeah will probably be pretty inactive on like discord until the 1st<br>
only a few days left until school aaaa<br>

also, am no longer doing math in the bathtub because grandparents house, unlike hotel, has rooms that are not bedrooms!!</div>

like actually not. chances looking very slim lol. I would need top 2 overall tst scores and am currently in 4th place and there’s only one tst left (Jan 12). so basically I’d need to perfect — or at least do very very well on — that tst to have a chance, aka a miracle would have to occur<br>
well, serves me right for not doing enough nongeo lol, and for kinda slacking for the past few months. also I guess I learned from the most recent tst that some problems are misplaced so maybe I should genuinely attempt each problem instead of skipping because it looks too hard. important lesson I guess lol.<br>
throughout my life I’ve kinda taken for granted that certain things were going to happen, like making aime, mop, etc — I kinda felt like they were part of my destiny and no matter how difficult, some miracle would occur and I would somehow achieve them<br>
but what if the miracle doesn’t occur? then I’m kinda screwed<br>
and so maybe I should stop taking things for granted because it ultimately takes more than just hope — it takes a ton of effort<br>
im still gonna try very hard on the Jan tst, but… better to come to the realization now rather than later :’)))<br>
maybe I should appreciate my past opportunities more, because my life has been pretty miraculous…</div>

anyway no comment on egmo tst until I get my score back :cry:<br>

once 2023 begins, it will be a complete whirlwind of doomsdays and extremely fun meetups and everything will just go by so fast<br>
this entire year is going by so fast nooo<br>
<br>
anyway I somehow need to stop being bad at combo<br>
but actually doing combo is hard because I don’t find it nearly as fun as geo, and hence when I do math I somehow almost always find myself doing geo…<br>
gonna have to somehow<i> force </i>myself to do combo sometime, or somehow make myself see the beauty of it but the latter seems much harder<br>
<br>
lol I don’t have the drive to do otis units anymore. somehow last year I felt compelled to do otis unit after otis unit; I even felt unproductive not doing it; but having exhausted all the “doable” units nowadays I feel more productive just doing problems on my own, since doing units too high above my level feels like leaning on arch for life support…<br>
oops am I just paying $300 for a discord server now :skull:<br>

oh and I’ve been surviving school by listening to way too much Spotify <img src="/assets/images/smilies/thumbup.gif" alt=":thumbup:" title=":thumbup:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

			<div class="message">am I even alive anymore<br>
last night I had like 3 scary dreams about mpfg oly<br>
then I dragged myself out of bed at 6:18, realizing that I had slept for 9 hours (which like never happens lol)<br>
didn’t feel like doing much; there were only 2 hours until my death. or, 2 hours till I would get dragged out of the ignorance and bliss of doing geo and forced to face the fact that I am trash at combo. kinda like being yanked out of a warm bed into the cold outside. 2 hours, not even enough time to fully ponder what was happening. all I knew was that I was doomed (mpfg oly is literally always all combo, which I’m bad at especially since I’ve been doing only geo for the past few weeks). I dragged myself to school, but for once I actually dreaded going to school. I actually for once wished I could just go to class instead of taking the mpfg oly. to just be able to sit in class and do boring schoolwork now felt like a dream. and then  it was 8:15 and the melancholic morning ended, and now I was <i>really</i> screwed.<br>
&lt;will not discuss what happened after that, speaking of which, when is discussion allowed??&gt;<br>
<br>
tbh days like this feel even more like doomsday than like, amc day because for AMC’s u literally just have to go quickly and carefully which is basically just having a certain mindset at least for me, whereas if the problems on an oly are hard (beyond ur level) then you <i>literally</i> can’t do anything other than like pray for a miracle<br>
maybe I’m just not good at oly lol<br>
<br>
next Thursday (first egmo tst) morning will likely be another repeat of this<br>
<br>
god I just really really miss when there wasn’t so much pressure to do well<br>
I guess this is what being old is like :/<br>
<br>
also, so much to do and I’m not even doing otis units anymore, what is happening T_T<br>
<br>
I think the end is near<br>
<br>
will try to be optimistic but reality exists oops</div>

			<div class="message">math isn’t for those who want satisfaction, it’s for those who can dream<br>
<br>
olympiad math is a crazy abstract thing. it isn’t directly applicable to the real world aside from maybe research math, and it’s insanely difficult. and there are way more people who aim to reach a particular goal than actually end up reaching it, so this very premise is full of disappointment. but somehow tons of kids on a particular website work 24/7 to get as good as they can at it. what drives them?<br>
to do math you kinda have to be heartless. you have to not care about your heart being broken, because that’s what will happen over and over again during the AMC’s, camp decisions, and many other competitions in between. you have to be somewhat reckless and somewhat detached from your senses, to not let the pain of failure sink in too deeply. you have to know that a lot of sadness is ahead of you but still have some intrinsic force pushing you towards it. any sane person would say this road is too emotionally dangerous; any sane mathematician would calculate EV of happiness to be negative. but yet we push on, undoubtedly towards death but on the journey solely for the tiny pockets of happiness along the way. what propels us? our dreams. huge dreams of some light at the end of the road somewhere in the future which we might just reach if we try super hard. it’s such a hazy picture, but if you are good enough at dreaming, you can convince yourself that something magical can happen if you continue to do math - and then, the pain and bleak realistic view of it all will fade and all become eclipsed by this fantasy. a million dreams are, literally, what is keeping us alive. if not for them, we would have given up by now, joined the rest of the population in their perfunctory, realistic lives.<br>

I know it’s unhealthy; my nonexistent NT skills are turning to dust and I’m already forgetting the useful pell equations and quadratic reciprocity strategies that I learned only a few weeks ago. I should really tend to those much weaker skills before indulging myself with geo, but thanksgiving is a time of no restriction and so I am over-consuming <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
sooner or later, I will fall apart, as reflected in the dream I had two days ago in which I wonderfully dreamed of doing geo and then woke up having scratched some of the skin off my ankles - something that is so satisfying in the short term but causes pain later on.<br>
<br>
however, right now, I’m arguably the happiest I’ve ever been. in the past there have been short periods of happiness, which almost always occurred after a (rare) success, and they kinda faded away within a few days, leaving only a number on a record somewhere. only very recently I’ve found that happiness is possible even when nothing extraordinary has just happened. these good days will probably end after I fail mpfg oly and egmo tst’s, but for the time being I’m so thankful for them.

			<div class="message">I’ve been inspired for &lt;decently large number&gt; of days now.<br>
ever since then, things have been a lot more happy and fantastically hopeful. feels like walking on air. even though I am not in any way better or more skilled than I was before, I am now able to be a lot more optimistic<br>
maybe the best way to describe this feeling is with this quote which I have now memorized word for word:
<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">the great gatsby wrote:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter— tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther— and one fine morning—<br>
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</div>
</div>
I wonder if the state of being inspired impacted how the AMC’s went. maybe, probably, the inspiration gave me an extra boost that I very much needed, almost like a shot of steroids, but mentally rather than physically, and in the form of pure hope. I’m extraordinarily thankful for this, and I don’t know, but the AMC’s likely would have gone worse if not for this<br>
it’s not only AMC’s, it’s everything. everything’s been tinted by the green light. there is now more purpose to doing anything, whether it be math (especially math) or anything else<br>
<br>
I would recommend being inspired sometime<br>
maybe the sad days of childhood have officially come to an end. every year things seem to get happier. comparing life nowadays to back when I was 8 and regularly cried, or 13 and felt like a failure, I am so so spoiled by happiness.<br>
so, with the help of inspiration, I can now believe in the green light, the fantastical future that we dream of though it seems impossible. it’s far away, but that’s no matter - every year things can get better and the dream can get closer— <i>and maybe someday—</i></div>

last night I dreamed that I had actually gotten one more incorrect and gotten 6 points less than I thought I did, which fortunately was not actually true.. why is 6 such a big number :/<br>

			<div class="message">this week is absolutely insane<br>
I have a test every day of the week and some other assignments<br>
our school goes by trimesters and this is the last week of the trimester so maybe that’s why<br>
I think my streak of not doing homework at home might just have to come to an end..<br>
12a score was confirmed<br>
amc 12b is tomorrow and this matters so much… it will determine how much of a shot I have at usamo and how I spend my time these next few months<br>
no less nervous than a week ago..<br>
<br>
just have to survive this week :pray:<br>
<br>
hmmt nov was fun lol, I didn’t do very well (absolutely bombed theme round lol) but whatever. my team (or 2 teams) really bonded over the experience, which was interesting. some of my teammates were pretty chaotic lol.<br>
no more math competition traveling until 1/21 : )</div>

did the first 15 quickly, got trolled by 16 and temporarily skipped it, skipped 17 too, sillied both 18 and 19 LMFAO (on 18 I thought it was the x axis bruh), did 20 which was a really nice problem, did 21 and 22, skipped 23 after attempting for one minute, began to bash 24 but then cheesed by mod 5, gave up on 25, solved 16 and checked answers and didn’t catch either of my sillies lmao rip</div> assuming no bubbling issues..<br>
for me, 120- is like “bad” and 130+ is like “good” and anything between those is some combination of bad and good, so idrk what to feel about this at all, probably smth like “emotionless but a little bit sad”<br>
I do need to get 11 on the aime now unless I do considerably better on the b, which will be hard.. <i>and so the next few months will likely be pain</i>

there's something really, really powerful about being inspired. which can be something very small, like watching an inspiring video<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">which definitely didnt happen in english class recently lmao</div> or reading a quote or looking at an image or listening to a song. or it can be something big, like an experience<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">.</div> but when in the state of having been inspired, one can accomplish so much more, almost like being on steroids, but way more genuine. it's one of the rare moments in which one can actually churn out straight productivity, not just fake productivity mixed with amounts wasting time. the only way to be <i>that</i> productive is to be inspired. if only inspiration wasn't such a fleeting feeling, and wore off so quickly, so that it's a major struggle to get back out of the pithole of unproductivity. eventually one finds oneself absentmindedly searching for the secret drug again. maybe the secret to being productive is just ... to be inspired.<br>

			<div class="message">Guys I hate to admit it<br>
actually never mind i LOVE to admit it<br>
that i have accepted my fate as a geo main<br>
I am praying hard right now that AMC last 5 has like 3 geo<br>
It's so funny.<br>
A year ago I was absolutely trash at geo.  There wasn't anything I wanted to do with geo, and everything I did with geo was frustrating.  I constantly asked questions, like "how the heck did this guy think of this solution" and it become IMMENSELY annoying<br>
<br>
And then I took a few tests and now I realize that <i>I have become that guy</i>.  And I truly cannot explain how the heck I came up with the solution. now after reading evan's great book about it and me with all my fancy schmancy bary and mixtilinear circles thinks im actually <b>good</b> at something for once in my life.  its always been "he &gt; me" and "she &gt; me" and "they better than u" and whatnot<br>
<br>
geo just <i>feels</i> better in a sense.   like, it's very approachable.  whereas nt and alg require precise methods and stuff that you would need to think about right out the gate, and combo where literally nothing is confident in the slightest (is this method right?  i think its right.<br>
its right because ___.  but wait no its not right because ___.  Hold on wait lets try to do this again.  wait no its not right dangit.  lets try something else.  (repeat x100)), geo is just easy to start.  You don't need a very good map of where you're going at the start, and a diagram gives you a good first step.  you can randomly postulate stuff and maybe it works and it feels good<br>
<br>
Is this progress?  I'm so not used to this feeling.  My confidence is riding a high right now for some reason, and now I actually feel kind of confident in my abilities for the first time in about 2 years.  My self-worth is directly correlated with how much time I spend at school with friends.<br>
<br>
Ironically, COVID affected my mental health more than my physical health.<br>
<br>
(v feel free to take this down i would normally put this on my blog but i posted myself into a hole and now i cant break the streak)</div>

			<div class="message">...I guess<br>
every day I get twice as scared about the amc lol<br>
living in ignorance rn cuz I don't really want to <strike>scare myself</strike> by taking more mocks<br>
I think especially during AMC, how calm/confident you are can really make a big difference in ur score lol<br>
maybe even more of an impact than ur actual math ability<br>
and so im just banking on hope rn<br>
<br>
schoolwork really piling up lol; so many things in these next 2 weeks and I'll have to miss school next friday to go to hmmt (which will be soooo fun lol <i><strike>wait im also not looking forward to crying on that day bc of the amc</strike></i>) but I can barely manage the makeup work that comes with missing a day of school<br>
a few days ago I had no school and tried the impossible task of limiting my phone screen time to 3 hours (I rarely use the computer lol) which was NOT a good idea, because I discovered that daydreaming is a thing<br>
and I did like a page of otis problems over maybe 8 hours?? with like a ton of daydreaming lol<br>
maybe it's good that I don't usually have huge amounts of free time like this<br>
so yea, will not try that type of experiment again in the near future..<br>
im supposed to be self studying ap cs this year but haven't even started so im gonna have to like grind it out during thanksgiving/winter break or smth because no time...<br>
im still able to get all hw done during school but dunno how much longer that will last... <i>hanging on by fingernails...</i><br>
<br>
kinda really want this next month to pass in a blink but I also don't because if it ends up passing and I end up failing all of the 50 billion things in the next month then I'll be devastated<br>
so I kinda want to exist in this limbo state forever, of extreme nervousness but no <i>regret</i>, because bad things <i>will happen but have not happened yet</i><br>
<br>
anyways, I am (barely) alive <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">it is only now, at the end of my competition math career, that I can actually feel AMC problems inside and out. not just the answer, or the solution path, but actually how they work; sometimes, the intuition behind the proposal of the problem. not to say that I can solve all AMC-level problems, as will probably be confirmed next month, but somehow they seem different this year, like little translucent gems on a table meant to be observed and eventually cracked open. six years (?) and finally I’ve fulfilled one of my elementary/middle school goals: to actually <i>understand</i> AMC problems.<br>
<br>
I can’t say this about olympiad problems, or even AIME problems. when I solve them, I can see through the top layer - just enough to find the solution - but there’s still a huge opaque chunk of problem waiting to be read and understood: all the theory that went into the problem, why everything should have worked the way it did, and many more alternate explanations for everything that you could only see from a bird’s eye view.<br>
<br>
it must be so nice to actually be able to understand olympiad problems, 100% of them and not just the solution. it must be like wandering in the 3rd or 4th dimension, where everything moves around you and to see why something’s true you only have to peer around a corner. though it’s nice to think about, I don’t think I’ll ever reach this heaven, because given how long it took me to <i>actually understand</i> AMC problems, olympiad problems will probably always remain a bit opaque - at least for the time left I have to do them.<br>
<br>
I can’t believe that there’s so little time left, that in less than a year I’ll have to yank myself out of any virtual realities I’m in and devote a good chunk of my brain to applying to college. I feel like a bird that has only just learned to fly, but I’m about to be yanked down again. it’s like a solid wall that I’m going to run into, and I’m just trying my very best not to think about when that will happen. I’ve been fleeing from this reality for so long - since I realized I was getting old, probably sometime last year - but at some point I’ll be able to flee no more, because I will literally come face to face with the wall.<br>
<br>
I am already slowly being pulled into the vortex of it (by parents, school, classmates, etc); no matter how hard I try to block it out, the warning calls keep getting louder; and I can already feel my demise. if only I had more time to fly… but one could also argue that if I had too much extra, I might get bored of flying. so, one more year to live in peace, and I better make the most of it. this will be the last time I see the fall colors so brightly. the last time I can turn over translucent gems and chase goals in the sky with no distractions. the last time I’m actually filled with hope and potential and believing, before the world turns upside down. there is less than a year left.<br>
<br>
maybe I would view this differently if I had older siblings or good friends who were significantly older than me; maybe the wall would be made of glass so that I could at least see the beautiful view ahead as I ceased to exist.<br>
<br>
this blog has become so pessimistic; I should post some optimistic things sometime xDDD</div>

			<div class="message">2 different parts that are completely unrelated to each other<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">cold</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">as it gets colder, I spend more time thinking about physical things. noticing the physical coldness and really feeling it. especially when I’m cold - I can’t actually ignore the physical aspect of myself because it’s constantly reminding me that it’s there, as is the world outside. and so I feel ever so slightly more distant from the online universe, maybe because my presence online is just a tiny discord avatar trapped on a 2-dimensional screen, that I can’t actually feel a fraction as vividly as when the thermostat drops 2 degrees. sometimes I scroll through lists of ppl on the right side of discord on my phone and wonder, are these people even real? names and avatars that seem familiar, yet I’ve only ever seen them on this few inches wide screen, on days in the 2-year time period that barely existed. maybe they only ever existed on this small screen, which has shown me so many other made up things, that who knows, they might be just another such made up thing.<br>
there’s something very different about in person interaction. especially when it’s cold - coldness is something everyone in the room can relate to, one of the few sensations that everyone might be experiencing at once. when it’s cold, something about the school feels more like a community. because everyone’s facing the same (minor) issue of staying warm. when you ask someone how they’re feeling, and they say cold, at least you can feel a tiny fraction of what their life is like at that moment. one of the things in person interaction does is it enables people to be feeling the same sensations at once, establishing some common ground - one of the wonderful effects of being at the same place at the same time.<br>
<br>
so on cold days at school when I’m staring into my phone for minutes on end, every so often something just seems a little bit off, almost as if I should get off of social media and re-assimilate with the real world.</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">being a leader</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">whenever I have to lead something, I feel a tiny tiny bit of nervousness/dread even if I have absolutely no reason to feel this way. for example, running math club at my school, or teaching a class online, etc - for the couple of hours beforehand I feel a tiny bit jumpy and nervous, even though I know it’s going to go completely fine. (mixed in with a great deal of excitement, of course.) but then a few minutes into the task, this feeling completely vanishes, and everything goes smoothly from there on. and furthermore, after the task is finished, depending on how much leading I just did, there is some amount of the complete opposite feeling - extreme braveness and lack of worry, like because I was just able to do that I should be able to do so much more.<br>
this has been happening ever since 7th grade, when I was a “teaching assistant” for the 5th grade math class down the hall and I was so, so scared every single time I had to do it, sometimes I couldn’t even make the trip down the hall and decided to skip that day. but every time when I actually made myself do it, I came back with the most wonderful feeling, like I could literally do that same thing 1000x over and enjoy every minute of it. fast forward a couple days and that feeling would completely wear off, and the vicious cycle would continue.<br>
4 years later, it’s definitely much less extreme. I don’t know what to make of this feeling - I really don’t think it’s a bad thing because feelings like this really are what makes life more interesting and not just a monotony, and so I’m somewhat grateful for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>sometimes I get tired of being a leader</i><br>
<br>
it feels so good to be in a zoom meeting and not one of the people running it. it feels so good to be in a club meeting having not planned the time/agenda. I guess this is what junior year is like; the final one or two years of any stage - middle school, high school, or college - are always marked with responsibility, like you’re supposed to be a role model for people a few years younger than you. several years of being a leader, several years of being a follower, and it continues. the transitions are always very smooth, like you’re slowly trained to be a leader and not forced right into it - and I think I’m finally able to fit myself into that description albeit with some difficulty - but still, I can’t help but every so often ponder about what it would be like to be a follower again.</div></div>

			<div class="message">winging just about everything at this point<br>
all classes are going<i> fine </i>except English which I still have a B+ in due to an in-class essay and there’s another in-class essay on Monday which apparently will be graded more harshly than the previous one<br>
I’m just gonna try my best not to fail<br>
report card things are coming out soon so kinda screwed<br>
the good thing about English though is that the homework load is really light - actually I would prefer in-class essays over take-home essays because the latter would take so much more time to do and are graded more harshly anyways and I only have time to do homework at school<br>
kinda ran out of amc mocks to do so am pausing the amc prep (oops doing a bunch of amc’s before mpfg most definitely did not help me at mpfg since the difficulty levels are like completely different lol)<br>
am going to try to get my school to host the 10/12b since the math circle might not be able to D:<br>
oh yeah I also winged the psat a few days ago with absolutely zero practice<br>
reading comprehension section was mehidkkindabad but I have literally no reference points to compare to… after that it kinda got steadily easier<br>
<br>
I haven’t done much geo recently D:<br>
actually I haven’t been doing much math in general recently<br>
last year I kinda just said screw school time to do otis units but this year I actually have to try with school<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">weird things that happened after mpfg</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I lost my sensitivity to cold for a few days. like I just didn’t feel cold even if it was cold. I think it is because there is a feeling much much worse than physical cold, and that is emotional cold. knowing that there is something you won’t be able to do, no matter how hard you try. that was what happened on the mpfg test- there were problems I knew I wouldn’t be able to solve because of lack of time. (oops this is a common feeling to just about any math competition lol) I guess with that feeling fresh in my mind it is hard to feel more superficial things, like physical cold<br>
(it eventually wore off after a few days)<br>
<br>
I also suddenly appreciated music more, especially edm, idk why<br>
like I appreciate each note more, instead of it just going in one ear and out the other<br>
on trips I don’t really listen to music and I guess not having something even for a short period of time makes one appreciate it more</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">on geo</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">literally the one thing that kept me alive throughout the pandemic, figuratively speaking<br>
when I think of those dark days* essentially being stuck in a house with little social interaction and zero irl social interaction, geo was the one thing lighting my way - I don’t know what I would’ve done in 9th grade without EGMO and geogebra. quite literally, I don’t know what I would’ve done with my time.<br>
to this day, EGMO (the book) is the only thing which really has ever really inspired me to get up at 4 in the morning every day and do math. it was purely the love of geo that made me do it. I don’t think I ever would have done such a thing, had it not been for EGMO. hopefully something along the way will again inspire me to wake up at 4 in the morning, but that has yet to come.<br>
*so when I think of those pandemic days, it doesn’t completely feel dark. there is also the beautiful side filled with my earliest geo memories - discovering and falling in love with the 9 point circle and such. sometimes I in fact wish I could spend another day in that dreamlike state of suspension, literally floating in geo heaven, completely detached from every aspect of the real world.<br>
<br>
I don’t think geo continues to have as a dramatic effect on me as that, but geo was what gave me the initial motivation to try really hard with math, and that motivation has carried on. and I still love it as much as ever.  so in a sense, I owe almost my entire math career to geo.</div><br>

			<div class="message">there’s one thing which is beating people who are older than you<br>
and then there’s another thing which is beating people your own age<br>
and then there is another thing which is getting beaten by people younger than you<br>
I think this mpfg has been useful in that it has taught me to no longer be scared of the third thing<br>
this was one of the first competitions I’ve been to where I’m actually one of the oldest ones, relatively speaking. not the youngest, not average age, but actually kinda old. and so younger kids are inevitably going to beat me. there’s something about being a child that makes you think older kids are by default bigger, stronger, and better, but I guess for adults this is not true, because age becomes really just a number, and so we must eventually phase out of that mindset<br>
so yeah I’m honestly just really proud of all the younger kids at mpfg, especially the ones that did better than me, because y’all are living the moment that you deserve after all these months/years of hard work. I’m kinda part of an older generation, which is soon going to phase out, allowing you room to flourish - and flourish you will.<br>
for the record I got 10th place (clutched top of tie with a really scuffed distrib) which I think was worse than what everyone else expected but given that 1) I voluntarily didn’t practice at all, and 2) I thought/worried too hard about it (and whenever I think too much about a competition, I end up getting something rated “really mediocre” on my scale of good to bad which is approximately what happened), I shouldn’t, and won’t, complain<br>
<br>
it’s especially stressful when you realize that one silly can cost you x amount of dollars - literally some of the scores were so close - so I prefer to completely ignore the money aspect of it and try to do it as much for fun as I can, because literally mpfg is one of the most fun experiences one can live through.<br>
so yeah I’m sorry if I let y’all down - I kinda feel bad being a “role model” to a lot of younger kids and then turning out to just be meh and not the great person that was imagined - but also, not doing very well is a very freeing experience because now everyone knows I don’t always do well, and hence I <i>no longer have to do as well</i><br>
one note about sillies, I “sillied” a lot of questions including 4 in the first 10, but I think sillies are kind of those inevitable things that you can’t really prevent because in the alternate universe when you didn’t make that one silly, you made another and so I can’t really use sillies to explain anything lol<br>
<br>
mpfg was actually incredible though, getting to see ppl from athemath, g2, daily challenge, mop, sparc, mc nats 2019, aops, and everything else in between, all at once. and seeing how little people change in 3 years - I swear, some people are exactly the same as I remembered them being. I guess I have one more chance to go to mpfg, and that one, like each of the previous years, will feel a whole different vibe given that I’ll be a senior and ACTUALLY one of the oldest, but I expect I’ll learn something from it just like I have been from everything else.</div>

			<div class="message">You guys are receiving this post because this genius forgot his phone at home (and thus no JLSS for me)<br>
<br>
I don't know how it happened, but my grades have gone downhill this year from the very start. I as of right now have Bs practically all of my classes, which is highly concerning halfway into the semester. The obvious conviction is that I have been under ridiculous stress from needing to make up 2 weeks of AP Humanities classes with the rest of my workload, but that excuse really does not provide any sort of solution. Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to have an expectation for myself to complete <b>24</b> OTIS units in 2 semesters. Frankly, I'm annoyed, because its not even from not doing the work, its me legitimately being an *expletive*.<br>
<br>
Either way, it probably wasn't a good sign taking 4 weeks to finish Entry Combo, even if I may have caught up slightly with Expected Value taking a single week. You'd expect poor performance in one area to imply great progress elsewhere, but so far my pace in OTIS is as mediocre as expected of someone who failed to make AIME last year, and barely scores over 100 on AMC12 when "reasonably confident".<br>
<br>
I don't even have the choice to pursue varied interests, because I've committed so much to OTIS and obviously need to not fail out of school. As much as I want to work on composition again, I know that its behind my 30 minutes daily of piano, 30 minutes of Japanese (why am I doing this again), weekly Chinese classes, and physics, which I haven't really reconciled with despite my intent to major in it for university and the looming last shot for USAPhO after I missed by a single point last year. Aaaaand I could probably put aside some time I spend on social media, but I'm convinced that if I don't talk , then I will have 0 sanity, which will obviously improve my function even more.<br>
<br>
How do you all manage not to burn the candle on both sides??? (I forgot the correct idiom)</div>

			<div class="message">being not a Bsian is difficult<br>
I have an 89 in English due to an essay… pain<br>
I also realized I should probably <i>not</i> do origami in classes that I’m not doing <i>really well</i> in or else I look like I’m just paying no attention so yeah corona star production has slowed and most of them I make in Physics<br>
I’m basically in 3 math classes rn (Diff Eq, Physics, Economics) and 3 foreign language classes (Chinese, English, Biology), of which the former are relatively easy and the latter relatively hard<br>
actually scared for mpfg ngl what if I fail<br>
the only memories I have of mpfg are of failing <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">well actually here is the full extent of my memories of mpfg<br>
<br>
I arrived at the game night like halfway through and kind of walked around in circles around the huge ballroom; I recognized a total of maybe 2 people there. everyone seemed to be hanging around in groups and I was kind of too shy to go up to anyone; btw I was a tiny 8th grader and kind of socially awkward<br>
I eventually made some origami 3d shapes because I was bored<br>
the next day was kind of a blur. I again didn’t really know anyone so I just kinda wandered around. I didn’t care that much about doing well on the test because it was my first time and I was expecting to fail, which I did. I think I got a total of like 4 problems correct. I kind of met some ppl who I kind of knew over the course of that day, including <b>mathicorn</b>, but I was too shy to go up to any orz people and spent a lot of the time just staring at orz people. the awards ceremony was pretty cool, there were some performances and then talks and then everyone stared at orz people getting trophies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
maybe I would’ve tried harder had I known that I wouldn’t be coming back to mpfg until 11th grade??<br>
<br>
wow, back in the days when I wasn’t expected to do well on anything…</div><br>
I have not practiced a SINGLE mpfg problem, ever, in my life, other than the few on OTIS Cyclotomic, so like I have no clue what the difficulty of mpfg is<br>
but I’m actually too scared to practice for mpfg so ykw I’ll just wing it and hope that it doesn’t go like the 2020 amc’s which I failed because I was too scared to practice and thus winged<br>
I’m really, really, <i>really</i> excited to meet everyone at mpfg tho!<br>
if this has sounded really incoherent maybe that’s because I typed it up over the course of a few days<br>
<br>
im kind of not doing as much oly these days because computational practice :/ im really scared that I won’t make usamo (ok but I’m even more scared that I won’t make mop <strike>and that the usamo will be lacking in a certain subject</strike>)<br>
<br>
oh yea and psat happening soon aaa<br>
<br>
I think the biggest thing I learned from sparc was to make eye contact. one day this kid told me to start making eye contact and it was kind of an epiphany. now im actually somewhat able to make eye contact with people while speaking to them, and it makes such a big difference<br>

			<div class="message">two very contrasting experiences I had last weekend<br>
first off, I went to New York City for a day and was pampered for no reason<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">but actually, what was the point of that, to have fun in Times Square? forget about all that’s happened since and timeskip back to the proudest moments of last year, barely memorable beneath months of time? I thought we were supposed to leave that behind, because that was last year, and there is more to come, right? it was fun but it wasn’t a complete reunion, because only one slice of June was present, and the rest were all college students, and so I sat in my hotel room and did otis problems slowly at the rate of 1/hr as flashing Times Square colors streamed in through the window, because I, unlike most of the people there, wasn’t done, not quite yet. the word jane street echoed through the walls and streamed in through the windows of the sunset colored, money filled floor to fill everyone else’s minds, hopes, and dreams, but it bounced right off me because college and my career is still behind a glass door in my mind, and besides my academia-loving family had brainwashed me. there was no time to waste, so I pretended not to be antisocial but yet went to bed at 9:30 hence missing all the card games and slept a long time as usual; and before long half of us had left, and I realized I may never see some of them again, but of course I hope otherwise. I continue to do otis problems slowly at the rate of 1/hr hoping that it will get me somewhere, maybe something culminating in an event like this that I might someday see differently.</div><br>
<br>
then I went to Baltimore for a day and watched my dad teach the basics of competition math to low-income kids math at a local middle school. (because daily challenge is potentially going to teach them or smth)<br>
those 6th graders were surprisingly engaged, way more focused than the rich kids at my school who don’t have to work hard because they already have everything. (thats the unfortunate thing about going to a private school, I don’t get exposed to these types of people enough.)<br>
but they actually wanted to learn and some were pretty smart too, smarter than many of the rich kids at my school. gap in knowledge level is very much related to the gap in accessibility to resources. anyways, even though they didn’t have money, those kids had hope. the exact opposite of too many people I’m surrounded by 5 days of the week.<br>
very interesting to see first the result of lots of time, money, and care combined with lots of motivation, and then, the presence of motivation without any of the other three.<br>
makes one feel really grateful for the little things in life, like food and shelter, let alone accessibility to math resources.<br>
<br>
I’m screwed for amc’s and the other 938593 computational contests coming up eeee<br>
<br>
I should really be testsolving mommy rn I have no time aaa<br>
<br>
just barely staying afloat <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

I used loose leaf paper for the past 2 years until sparc when I found it more convenient to use notebooks but actually now I realize loose leaf paper is more convenient because lighter, doesn’t have lines, and much easier to do geo on as you can actually rotate the paper to draw circles<br>
might switch back asap<br>

			<div class="message">everything is going by so quickly<br>
being productive enough while getting enough sleep is becoming near impossible oops<br>
I do a majority of my day’s math between 4:30 and 7:00 am and losing that time to sleep is actually detrimental<br>
so basically the later I wake up the less time I can spend on discord and such<br>
and this is even with spending 0 time on homework outside of school<br>
I get really tired around 9pm so I guess my ideal sleep schedule allowing for maximum productivity would be 9:00-4:30<br>
also, my algebra/nt/combo brain shuts off around 8:30 pm. I can still do geo after that, albeit barely, but all higher dimensions of brainpower I need to see through an algebra/nt/combo problem go inaccessible to me and I am stuck in only the trivial dimension, in which I can figure out nothing.<br>
I need to stop forcing myself to do x otis problems a day, because this is causing me to skim my way through problems, look at too many hints, and simply stall because of time pressure -<i> I know I only have x minutes left to do math</i> - I’m actually so bad at time pressure, idk how I’m going to survive any math competitions this year<br>
I need to simply come to terms with the fact that I won’t be able to do as much math as I want some days<br>
and how/if the heck I’m going to make mop this year I don’t know; it will be really hard at this rate given my dwindling amount of free time. but I absolutely have to make mop; there are a billion reasons why<br>
my dad says to just be more efficient with my time - like the really pro people don’t spend that much time on math they just focus so hard??? which I wish I could do, but I have such a bad attention span<br>
at least I have extinguished the urge to doodle on my paper, as aresult of banning myself from doodling since june<br>
whatever, this year will be a rough one. a huge difference from last year, at least, and we’re only halfway through September. but a challenge is a good thing.<br>
<br>
my parents now care more about my acting skills than math skills. they literally don’t seem to care anymore how well I do in math competitions. which kind of disturbs me because I feel like they do care but are just assuming everything will go like it usually does, <strike>and also because they are now okay with throwing as much daily challenge work at me as they want, since my free time no longer needs to be kept guarded</strike><br>
anyway, according to my parents it would be a better use of my time to improve on acting skills. I don’t know what they’re high on.<br>
<br>
I remember when we used to all want to be the same<br>
that time when we all had the same snivy profile pic, such a herd mentality.<br>
back then I didn’t want to be my own person. I felt embarrassed showing any sign of uniqueness, down to even changing my discord username to something that represented me. I remember v_enhance asking me “why is your name Ivy?” I remember when we used to self deprecate, and I wasn’t brave enough to title a blogpost “life update” because that would imply the fallacy that I had a life. we were so unsure, sustained only by the fact that there were others just as unsure as we were, and about the same things. no one wanted to stray from the formula, the one we all assumed to be the only recipe for success in math competitions and/or real life, and so we were all the same.<br>
I even more deeply miss 7th grade, aka pre-covid. in particular mathcounts nationals. those were the days when I felt the most like I fit in, the most connected. it was so simple, but the physicality and offline-ness of it made it more connected even than when I shared the exact same discord username and pfp with countless others for a whole half year. I can’t wait to go back to the real world.</div>

			<div class="message"><i>shortage of time</i><br>
<br>
there is a shortage of time<br>
till the amcs, till the end of highschool, till the end of today<br>
hence why I waited so long to make this post oops<br>
minimizing time wastage is the goal, but even if it does happen, there is still a shortage of time…<br>
<br>
<i>september is a lonely month</i><br>
<br>
at least the past 2 septembers were pretty lonely<br>
the start of the school year is in a way like starting again; pushing aside all your accomplishments from the previous year and starting again from scratch. sure your accomplishments still exist but you’ve got to prove yourself again<br>
and so september is like as far away from happiness and satisfaction as you can get, if you viewed it materialistically like that.<br>
but actually things happened in september 2020 and 2021 that were completely unrelated to this… some of you know…<br>
anyway, I think the reason why it’s lonely is because everything is so far away<br>
I think I just miss seeing people apart from the people I see at school<br>
aka I’m excited af for mpfg and moac and bmt and cmwmc and all other social events that will happen someday<br>
anyway I should probably cherish the speed at which time is traveling at the moment because it will speed up next month and the month after that<br>
<br>
oh yeah speaking of that arml practice started today, my arml practice has been renamed “Western PA Math Circle”<br>
and literally all of JV is so young it’s kind of sad that I am so distanced from the middle schoolers of today like over time I interact and relate less and less with them its kind of sad<br>
if I haven’t said already the math circle thing is like supposed to be for high schoolers but it’s mostly middle schoolers<br>
so yeah now I’m kinda like one of the oldest kids<br>
and I wish I was a middle schooler since they have so much time and opportunity and… yeah I just wish I were not an old high schooler<br>
but yeah that’s the next generation of our math circle I guess<br>
<br>
as you can tell I don’t interact much with people older than me, otherwise I’d probably see the benefits of being older<br>
but I don’t. so I just constantly wish I were younger :p<br>
<br>
<i>always remember</i><br>
<br>
9/11<br>
extreme tragedies happened on this day<br>
in English class we were talking about how our generation is really desensitized to violence and tragedy from so much exposure to social media and doesn’t see the gravity of serious situations and this is a problem<br>
but even if we didn’t witness this (were fortunate enough to not have) we’ve got to understand that something extremely terrible and unlawful happened on this day<br>
so honor the survivors and the victims and everything the world did to help on this day..<br>
<br>
cmu flag was at full mast today and fence read “rip colonialism - let her speak”<br>
<br>
<i>the question</i><br>
<br>
I always come back to this question of, if I am actually better off just doing geo. I sometimes try doing nongeo (hence the large pile of nongeo otis units I tried) but I don’t think my skill in nongeo ever improves. because I still get stuck on the nongeo problems in contests… and at the same time, my geo skill decreases. so is it objectively better for me to just do geo so that my geo skill won’t decrease, and wing all the other subjects??<br>
<br>
the only issue is the limited amount of geo sources…<br>
<br>
alright thanks for listening to me rant ^_^</div>

			<div class="message"><i>you don’t have to be good at anything, you just have to be confident…</i><br>
math is all about confidence<br>
the chance that I solve a problem is largely correlated with how confident I am that I can solve it<br>
<br>
now I know why I am attached to geo<br>
<br>
there is an immortal feeling I get after solving a difficult geo problem which is like, <i>I can attempt any geo problem now. no matter how hard it is - I’ll give it a shot. even if I have no chance of solving it - I’ll attempt it as if I know I can.</i><br>
<br>
only when I have that mindset can I actually solve problems<br>
and the issue is that, when I don’t do geo for a while, the mindset fades<br>
hence why I’m addicted to geo<br>
it’s like a drug that I need to survive<br>
speaking of that I need more sources of geo…<br>
<br>
of course this doesn’t happen with any other subject… and likely never will<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>on surviving junior year</i><br>
<br>
still haven’t figured out how to<br>
the workload is so much bigger than last year… classes are definitely harder, and also maybe I’m trying to please the teachers because letters of recommendation exist - I could just bs everything and have a lot more free time; that would be an easy way out. (I hate this, I hate that I’m doing something just for college applications. but I am.) and of course, I have to somehow get good grades too.<br>
<br>
well obviously I have to cut time from something, so I’m gonna try and stop wasting time on Instagram and the aops blogroll and spend as much of my free time on math as possible. and wake up at 4 every day and only do homework at night when I have literally no energy to do anything else. yeah right. that is totally gonna last more than a week.<br>
<br>
it’s so, so different from last year when I had time to do math during school - like what the heck - and spend almost all my time at home on it. I had more free periods last year, also less desire to please teachers.. and less confidence to do so<br>
<br>
but right now I have the most free time I’ll ever have, and though I’m losing free time now, there will be something much bigger to lose in a year: my connection to olympiad math.<br>
<br>
I should treasure these next 12 months.</div>

			<div class="message">forgot how time consuming school was<br>
<br>
barely any time to do origami in class let alone other things because I often have to look like I’m paying attention<br>
got caught not taking notes in math class<br>
I basically have a free period every day tho which is very nice<br>
so far have not needed to do any homework at home, but… that may change<br>
all classes are fun except ap lang (ok I’m just bad at english) and ap bio is just a slight bit boring (it’s ok tho cuz I can do origami at my seat) <strike>and chorus which I am forced to take</strike><br>
over time non-humanities classes get more and more math involved which is interesting<br>
<br>
am working through the last few geo otis units I have left to do :cry: after that I’ll have to find my own sources of geo<br>
<br>
despite how much of my free time school has taken away, it has actually improved my work ethic because now I actually don’t have time to just waste<br>
<br>
—random stuff—<br>
<br>
it’s weird how much my parents have changed over time. ten years ago they were so much more strict and I could not have imagined them doing some of the things that they do now. and they are also so much more caught up with popculture and use terms young people use nowadays. like I remember when I was little I wasn’t allowed to say “cool” because that was seen as a symbol of popculture degeneracy and materialism but now my parents say it all the time.<br>
<br>
how is everyone at my school so good at talking. especially in my ap lang class. so many ppl are able to make the words flow so elegantly and smoothly and I need to learn this art.<br>
<br>
oh also. I have given up all forms of art (aka drawing)  for the time being. I am sacrificing my (nonexistent) art skill for math skill. It was a good way to let out my emotions, but I don’t think I have the time.<br>
<br>
I don’t know; should I be trying harder with math right now? I know for a fact that I definitely can, but I don’t know if I want to push myself to that level of stress. this year makes all the difference though; it’s my last chance and looking back, I’ll probably wish I had tried harder. is a year of suffering worth the amount of happiness and satisfaction it’ll provide over a lifetime?<br>
I don’t know though, because I want to love math, and to do that I have to not suffer.<br>

lowkey scared of ap lang tho cuz I’m bad at english<br>
definitely feels more serious than last year tho. this year is supposed to be the hardest year of high school, kinda, so the teachers are all going extra hard on us.<br>

			<div class="message">this is not one of the posts that I have the sudden urge to write<br>
this is just    a post . about me rambling about life .<br>
<br>
so uh school in 4 days yayayay<br>
I recently got a new setup for teaching and livestreaming in an upstairs room, basically all my monitors and lights were nice up there and now I can do much more teaching/subbing because my family doesn’t have to live in the dark every time I’m teaching (I used to teach in the living room LMAO) and also yayayay lots more space on my desk now<br>
<img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
Athemath and Daily Challenge and OTIS really do be sucking up all my time. I remember when I actually had time to fool around on geogebra and lie in bed for a long time and waste time playing set…<br>
me freaking out every day over if I haven’t done a good enough job with Athemath outreach and maybe the classes will only have 3 students like F21 aaaa ppl I need ur help<br>
<br>
I happen to naturally wake up exactly seven hours after I get in bed. quite convenient actually.<br>
have fortunately recovered my 10-5 sleep schedule<br>
<br>
recently someone said “to strengthen your strengths, instead of focusing on strengthening weaknesses, or else we’d all be the same” which is interesting to me, as a very strongly weighted one-subject main<br>
I should get better at other subjects, but not to the point that my geo skill is threatened by any of my skills in other subjects.<br>
<br>
I am so looking forward to doing Super Complex and Super Bary with synthetic :star_struck:<br>
<br>
what the heck makes the TA community so awesome? holy heck, I used to think OTIS was the greatest community I’d find in the near future. in high school maybe. but the TA community is also reaching that level on my tier list… although the TA community is as different from OTIS community as can be, it’s an absolute wonder. everyone tries so hard and is so dedicated and self-motivated. not with math, but with teaching and teaching others how to teach. as an admin TA I feel like I should be doing more (the other admin TA’s are literally like running their own events for newcomer TA’s just because they want to, and dang, that’s impressive) but like danggggg you all are just AMAZING.<br>
even OTIS is kinda getting toxic*, but the TA community remains an oddly perfect wonder.<br>
<br>
* well not compared to like 90% of other servers, but ykyk<br>
<br>
if you want to know why being a TA is so awesome, for me it’s because it makes. you. more. confident. in everything. you actually learn how to talk confidently and be encouraging and talk with your hands. my mom says anyone who is a TA for a few months is completely and utterly transformed.<br>
<br>
I am only in the process of being transformed<br>
<br>
I think this is why I’m so excited to go to school. because I can’t wait to interact with ppl at school differently. I think it will be different now that I am, at least somewhat, transformed.<br>

			<div class="message">today was a wonderful day<br>
for absolutely no reason at all<br>
I woke up at 4:30, was amused by how many PST'ers were awake, binge listened to EDM, struggled on a tetrominoes problem for the 29578329th time, gave up after less than an hour, typed up sols to <i>courage</i> problems until 8:30,<br>
wasted some time on discord,<br>
then decided to attempt the amber and bronze problem. I'd never actually finished solving it myself, but I've seen bits of other peoples solutions. I couldn't remember anyone else's solutions off the top of my head though. so I just struggled on the problem<br>
for like 3 hours straight<br>
until lunch<br>
like an absolute clown<br>
then after lunch I suddenly realized something completely separate from the direction I was working in, like idk how it occured to me, it was almost like magic, and just like that the problem was crushed. I think what occurred to me might've been part of someone else's solution that I just suddenly recalled.<br>
anyway<br>
then I worked on athemath advertising, I tried to make a flyer but kind of failed because I made a very low quality one, and then worked on stalking important math people and organizations for contact info (being on athemath outreach be like)<br>
then my family wanted to go swimming <strike>but I didn't really want to</strike> so I left late and then walked by myself to the swimming pool and then found that I couldn't get in to the swimming pool because I had arrived late, perfect excuse to go back home and go biking instead, but it was raining so I biked for a total of 5 minutes, then I took a shower and created a better athemath flyer that Ali actually approved of, and then decided to go biking again when it was raining less and biked for more than 5 minutes, and then ate dinner in 10 minutes and taught a daily challenge class which was supposed to have 7 students but somehow had 15,,<br>
yeah great times<br>
<strike>tho I will actually have to go swimming on Wednesday so rip</strike><br>
time to continue trying to advertise athemath<br>
<br>
<br>
on another note, otis has successfully forced me to do non-geo<br>
something nice about combo and especially nt is that you don't need paper to do it, u can just think abt it in ur head or smth<br>
<strike>and unfortunately the same cannot be said about geo</strike><br>
but geo is still my favorite ofc &lt;3</div>

			<div class="message">2 weeks until school<br>
actually kinda excited<br>
but maybe this is bc I keep hearing abt school since lots of ppl have already started school<br>
otis started so I’m working on some units<br>
did basically all the ez ones last year tho, so this yr will be challenging… xD<br>
finally have a way to spend my time that’s not isl geo, which is good cuz I kinda ran out of doable isl geo :/<br>
I do want to attempt isl combo at some point too<br>
ahhh there’s so little time, the time I have to take comp math seriously is quickly vanishing ahhhh<br>
otis is different than 1 year ago, with all the new ppl. I still remember when a lot of ppl who used to be active still were.<br>
otis is addicting in that it’s hard to do things I need to do (that are less fun than otis) when otis exists<br>
I’ve been using phone so much that I think my nearsightedness is getting worse????</div>

			<div class="message">yesterday… or was it today?? I can’t even keep track<br>
I’m too lazy to actually pack rn so im just writing a blog post<br>
anyway, a lot of g2 people decided a while ago that we were going to attempt painting the cmu fence<br>
which is like a small fence used for advertising for various clubs and events and stuff<br>
We soon found out that there are many rules though<br>
Like that the fence must be painted between midnight and sunrise, with small hand brushes and real paint not spray paint, and before painting it you have to “claim” it for the night by “guarding” it for the evening until you actually paint it<br>
so us g2 people planned to pull an all nighter on the last night and paint the fence during that time. But we soon learned that there was another group (of non-cmu students trying to do some sort of a scavenger hunt) trying to paint it too, the same night we wanted to paint it, so we had to somehow claim it first.<br>
“claiming” it involves having 2 people from your organization on the gravel at all times. So we did this starting 11:30 am yesterday, we even ate lunch and had class out there until it rained. And some g2 ppl sat on the fence all afternoon while the rest of us went to squirrel hill. In the late afternoon/early evening, me and Jessica were guarding the fence alone. Then some very nice cmu organization who agreed to help us (they are basically enemies of the other organization) came to deliver paint and brushes. They had a lot of stuff in their car so me and Jessica decided (very stupidly) to help the lady get stuff from the car. But in doing that we stepped off the gravel for 2 minutes, and the enemy organization swooped in and claimed the fence. So we were no longer allowed to paint it exactly at midnight. (Oops, we are kinda stupid.) Then me and Jessica sat on the fence throughout the entire talent show in case anything happened; it was raining which was slightly annoying. After the talent show, we gathered enough g2 ppl there that we eventually compromised so that we paint the front of the fence and the other organization painted the back, which we were very satisfied with. So some g2 ppl chilled by the fence for a couple of hours until midnight when we could start painting it. Everything worked pretty well from there; the other organization finished painting at like 2 (they are sooo good at art btw and their side looked way more aesthetic than ours) and we finished at like 4. Yes, we were literally watching paint dry.<br>
then I spent an hour cleaning paint off my hands (it just wouldn’t come off) and took a shower and then went to a room where people were actually doing isl g2’s at 5am. True dedication. I was very unproductive for a bit and then went to watch the sunrise which was basically just sitting by the fence and talking.<br>
So I pulled a 2nd all nighter yayy<br>
ppl are leaving today which is sad <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">(((( g2 was very fun and I really hope to go again next year</div>

			<div class="message">g2 actually so fun<br>
it gives off a lot of mop vibes<br>
the food is a lot better than mop tho<br>
the problems are cool<br>
and we have a lot of free time<br>
<br>
I spent hours yesterday afternoon and this morning working on the remainder of isl geo that I haven’t done (basically I am just going back and forth through the years trying to do problems) and I didn’t solve a single problem in those few hours, though I attempted probably like 4 problems<br>
at this point every problem I solve I’ve probably attempted 4 or so times, in chunks over this past year, and spent ~5 hours total on<br>
I am trying to teach myself to <i>give up</i> on problems I actually have no chance of solving… which is a hard thing<br>
<br>
anyways back to g2, g2 is literally the complete opposite of sparc<br>
everyone here is so invested in math, so energetic and excited and youthful. I’m one of the oldest people here. The word “career” is not brought up once and when it is, the first thing that people think of is math professor. Not Jane Street or anything, just math professor. No one gives income or adulthood a thought because everyone has such a pristine, math-loving soul, and I absolutely love it. Ignorance is bliss.<br>
You can actually find people doing math at all times of day, including at the dining hall. Just like mop. At g2, I feel like I am surrounded by the next generation of female mathematicians - since many of the ppl here are younger than me - and it is amazing to see how much potential the youth have.</div>

			<div class="message">honest thoughts:<br>
<br>
I feel like I can’t believe what they taught me at sparc AND do well in math contests at the same time. Because everything sparc teaches you is distracting and pushes you in the exact opposite direction of math contests. Sparc teaches you about the real world, and how math contests aren’t actually that useful later on, how mop is actually of very little value (in the long run). I think going to sparc is helpful for someone who’s just about finished with contest math, because it gives you a new direction to turn towards. But for someone who is still planning on trying very hard with contest math, it’s pretty distracting.<br>
<br>
Because it’s too hard to focus on two things at once (the long term and the short term), I’ll just box up everything I learned from sparc and keep it in the back of my head for the next 1.5 years.<br>
<br>
What I actually learned from sparc:<br>
<br>
There are 3 good career paths for math kids: finance (Jane Street), tech (AI), and this other thing called Effective Altruism<br>
The problem is, none of them interest me that much at the moment.<br>
There’s a super useful skill called agency which is really hard to put a finger on, but basically it’s having the confidence to take charge and do whatever you want in a socially acceptable way.<br>
Olympiad math really does just end when you graduate high school.<br>
<br>
Time to go to g2 and realize that I am now trash at math!!!!<br>
And be surrounded by the math community again. Hopefully being around young, energetic math kids will have the opposite effect on me as being around old math kids who view math as “a sad reminder of childhood”.<br>
<br>
I will do everything I can to not end up viewing math as “a sad reminder of childhood”.<br>
But @everyone I met at sparc, love you all!!!</div>

			<div class="message">When I came to sparc, someone told me that sparc would encourage me to think about my future and the real world. Which I kind of dreaded, because I prefer to hide behind the facade of math competitions? Even though it will completely crumble in &lt;2 years? I have some strange belief that the more I block out other things in the world the more I can do is and do well in math competitions. But anyways, I had a convo with Eyed and goodbear yesterday which made me think more about… the future.<br>
So I compiled a list of very rough life goals.<br>
<br>
1. Become a math professor (idk, every single other person at mop wants to work at Jane Street but I’m just different I guess :/)<br>
2. Become involved in the math community (like, come back to mop as a grader/instructor or smth. I want to be a part of the one thing that gave me so much happiness when I was younger - math competitions.)<br>
3. Have a family (self explanatory)<br>
4. Preserve geo (I will try my best to make olympiad geo not die, especially on American contests, whether that means heightening my ability to propose problems or educating ppl about the wonders of geo. I’m dead serious about this.)<br>
5. Die satisfied (classic)<br>
<br>
This conversation was very interesting because it made me realize that the next 2 years will be really short and really life-changing. Rising seniors already seem to have a very, very different view towards math, and the real world, than most of my rising junior friends. I have no idea how much my mentality will change in one year.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I have been thinking about whether I should have gone to sparc or mathcamp after all. Sparc was free while mathcamp was 2000 dollars, so that’s why I chose what I chose. And for the past 2 weeks I’ve been slightly regretting this decision because a lot of my friends are at mathcamp, and I think mathcamp is closer to mop than sparc is. Had I known this beforehand, maybe I would have chosen mathcamp.<br>
But I also see now (and you can probably tell) that sparc is way different from mop/mathcamp in terms of what the atmosphere and what they teach you. And sparc has changed me.<br>
Also, according to Eyed, mathcamp is basically just 5 weeks of fun. Would I actually want 5 weeks of fun? During the whole thing it must seem dreamlike, but at the end the sadness that ensues is often proportional to the amount of fun and I don’t know if I would want to go through the mop aftermath all over again. Maybe just a tiny bit of amazingness each summer is enough for me. Idk, maybe I’m just trying my best to convince myself that I’m not missing out.<br>
I don’t know if I will attempt to come back to sparc, but the more likely answer is yes.</div>

			<div class="message">In short I have been spending a lot of time with the more mathy ppl at sparc such as the moppers (which is ~25% of sparc) but I have also met some very interesting non math ppl which is cool<br>
Classes vary a lot in interesting-ness<br>
But some of them are very, very interesting. A lot of the instructors are very very cool.<br>
We also do these things called 1 on 1’s where u basically have a private conversation with a random person<br>
Is interesting<br>
Sparc bucks (the sparc currency) is interesting, I have not gained/lost much money yet tho bc I never play poker<br>
I’ve been sleeping 10-6 every day so not tired yay<br>
And doing geo in the mornings<br>
Eyed got Covid rip. 3 ppl have gotten Covid so far including Eyed and a Brazilian IMO team member who is also a geo main<br>
I wonder how long it will be until I get Covid<br>
I feel like my work ethic is kind of deteriorating lol. It’s kinda hard to do a lot of math while at a camp, esp sparc because it has kind of made me used to relaxing. I hope I will regain my work ethic afterwards tho, rip lol<br>
I have only done a few math problems recently which are exclusively isl geo and a math problem Espen gave me from maker breaker percolation (which was actually a pretty cool combo problem)<br>
am going to play secret hitler soon ! !<br>
<br>
Oh also I had some very interesting conversations with past moppers, Laura can confirm. Interesting as in actually interesting, not the sarcastic interesting we all know. I’ve met a lot of ppl here who used to be 100% olympiad math ppl but who are now too old for math competitions, and it has dawned on me that maybe olympiad math should not be my entire life because in 1.5 years this will be forced to be so.<br>
<br>
At sparc the concept of “olympiad math” is kind of viewed bittersweetly. When you tell one of the instructors you’re an olympiad math person they kind of think you are one of those tryhards who doesn’t really have a clue what they’re doing but is hailed in the math community, which is really just a fake gang of tryhards. Even the olympiad math gods at sparc do not think of math as a godly thing. They think of it as a sad memory of childhood.<br>
<br>
I know I said a lot of contradictory things in this post but yeah, idrk what I’m doing and I do at the same time.</div>

			<div class="message">sparc day 1…. Maybe 2…<br>
I woke up  at 3:45 as a result of not being able to sleep because I was too excited<br>
Then I went downstairs and did some oly geo while listening to Defying Gravity and Another Day of Sun on repeat<br>
Then I successfully drove to the airport at 5:30 and successfully got on the plane<br>
I got one of those passes where u don’t have to take off ur shoes at security LOL<br>
I then did some more oly geo on the plane before falling asleep for the last half hour<br>
When we landed, it was 9:30 am pst which was weird<br>
I found the sparc ppl and played 24 with one of the junior counselors for a while<br>
We just chilled for a few hours while waiting for more ppl at the airport<br>
And I started to see how chill sparc is: it’s SO chill. Literally everything is optional and you’re encouraged to do literally whatever you want.<br>
We eventually left for the sparc venue around noon, then chilled there and played games and stuff for a few hours. I met a lot of sparc ppl there.<br>
Sparc ppl are interesting. They’re smart, but they’re not math people (at least the majority of them). And many of them are very, VERY good at talking, which I admire.<br>
I’m just not going to mention everyone’s aops names because a lot of ppl here don’t have them<br>
We had dinner at like 6 pst and the dining hall is HUGE. Very fancy food compared to resnik, lol. There were a ton more summer camps there.<br>
Then we had opening ceremony for 2 hours in the main meeting building<br>
Everyone was there, which is cool<br>
There are a ton of staff<br>
<br>
Another note: I cannot tell junior counselors apart from students. Almost everyone looks around the same age here<br>
<br>
Then I took a shower and went to bed around 9:45. The rooms are insanely fancy. They’re more like apartments, like there are little lounges and kitchens and private bathrooms for every 2 rooms.<br>
<br>
I woke up at 4:45 and tried to do some more oly geo, failed again at interviewing someone for athemath (they didn’t show up), and then went to a downstairs room to do geo with Eyed.<br>
Then I went to breakfast with Eyed and my roommate Linda around 7:30. There was no line at all. Then we had lots of time until the day actually started so we chilled and walked around.<br>
Classes are… definitely not math based (at least not most of them). (It’s very very different from mop.) They’re interesting though.<br>
The afternoon is basically just optional activities<br>
I think sparc is exposing me to a very different part of the intellectual community.<br>
<br>
However, if I get too used to a chill lifestyle at sparc then idk how the transition to g2 will go LOL</div>

			<div class="message">today was my brother’s birthday. we basically just made a cake and called relatives and I spent the rest of the day teaching a daily challenge classes and chilling on discord and doing geo.<br>
<br>
I remember how exactly two years ago, I was having the time of my life. I was (really slowly) doing the EGMO book and realizing how nice and wonderful geo was. That was when I first fell in love with geo. I guess I’m just chasing after that dream now, trying to relive the moments from two years ago, even though I shouldn’t be. I should be moving on and finding more moments to live through, things that I’m not already familiar with.<br>
<br>
Those were still the best days, even now.<br>
<br>
I’ve realized a while ago that I am a creature of habit; I find one way to do something that works and then keep doing it that way. I think this is my fatal flaw.<br>
<br>
During the OTIS school year I somehow have the urge to do OTIS 24/7. Like spend 100% of my free time on it. (And not only geo units.) So I literally cant work on any personal projects, such as writing an account of my life* or even reading MONT, because I just have to do OTIS units. I don’t know why this is. Maybe it’s because OTIS costs money and so every minute spent not doing OTIS is like a tiny cent slipping away. Okay I know this makes no sense at all. I think a better explanation would be that, once OTIS starts I immediately get addicted to OTIS units. It’s an actual addiction. I don’t know if I’m addicted to solving problems or improving or thinking that I’m improving. Probably a combination of the first and the third. But either way, like I said, I’m a creature of habit. And so, I can’t stop.<br>
<br>
*ok so for a really long time I have been thinking of writing a brief account of my life from my current point of view, just to look back on when I’m older. But I’ve literally never found time to work on it because it’s at the absolute bottom of my priorities list. So the only times I’ve actually worked on it are right before the AMC, AIME, and USAJMO, because at those times I feel like doing absolutely nothing productive. And so I end up waiting so long that my “current point of view” changes, and so I haven’t progressed very far on this project.<br>
<br>
I’ve heard that NT can be as beautiful as geo.<br>
<br>
Teaching daily challenge classes makes me better at talking. That’s strange, making kids better at math makes me better at talking. But the feeling of teaching is extremely satisfactory, you can almost call it addictive. Anyone who has taught daily challenge classes would know what I mean.<br>
<br>
Going to bed before 10 is hard.<br>
<br>
Waking up before 6 is hard.<br>
<br>
I still haven’t woken up before 6:30 since mop.<br>
<br>
It’s July 15th, which means that OTIS starts in one month, and I have exactly one month to do whatever random stuff I want.<br>
<br>
I think going to mop has also depleted my ability to write. It took forever to find enough words for this post.</div>

			<div class="message">in some ways, I am a completely different person<br>
- EVER SINCE THE ALL-NIGHTER I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WAKE UP BEFORE LIKE 6:30. BRUH. WHAT. I have lost the precious morning time <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> (ok this might also be a result of teaching daily challenge classes until 10:15 and having to go to bed late)<br>
- even weirder: I get 8-9 hours of sleep a day. I used to get like 6-7 and very rarely 8… WHAT THE HECK<br>
- I think I enjoy math more. I have more motivation to do math, maybe because I have a concrete goal to aim for and strive to achieve (mop next year obviously, because the experience was just so immaculate)<br>
- as a result I waste slightly less time on social media (well more like certain types of social media, which doesn’t include discord)<br>
- the mop songs are still stuck in my head and I can’t get them out<br>
- I think I appreciate my mom’s food a bit more<br>
<br>
(But basically the first two things are the main thing supporting this claim)<br>
<br>
Other things that are happening:<br>
- I’m going to be teaching even more daily challenge classes for these next few days (basically just subbing for other ppl who can’t make it to their classes)<br>
- I’m dying on 2011 isl g3. I spent a whole half day on 2011 g8 and finally solved it, and then I spent more than half of a day on the 2011 g THREE and still can’t solve it. <strike>I actually do not like this problem.</strike> Edit: I finally solved it, using moving points (!?!), with a lot of help from someone<br>
Edit again: nvm I fakesolved<br>
Edit: ok I think I got it for real this time<br>
- Athemath stuff to do since I’m board now<br>
- I kind of learned how to drive and now I can drive around the neighborhood (but not very fast, like max 25 mph. This is still with my mom helping me tho, and I still can’t drive on the highway and stuff.)<br>
Counting down the days until SPARC! I think SPARC will be a quite different experience from MOP because basically everyone I’ve talked to has said that [other math/stem camp ppl] are less nerdy/weird than moppers <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"> but that’s interesting, I will meet lots of different types of ppl <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">so uh I kind of want time to pass quickly so I can get to more exciting parts of life but these mostly empty days are actually painfully luxurious because someday I'll look back and wish I had more of them<br>
<br>
There's like nothing I have to do right now other than teach Daily Challenge classes and eat and exercise and sleep<br>
There are like almost not enough things to spend my time doing, untalentedness be like...<br>
So as a result I'm just spending a lot of time doing math but often I am too lazy to do nongeo (I swear I will try to do a lot of nongeo once otis starts) so I just do geo<br>
<br>
I've been sleeping 8-9 hours a day<br>
Loneliness has slightly worn off<br>
I've driven twice very slowly around an empty parking lot. Kinda hard at first.<br>
I think it's good that Instagram got hacked because one less thing to waste time on.<br>
I do spend a lot of time reading aops blogs and mit blogs and various others though. idk some blogs are just fun to read.<br>
<br>
why is old isl geo so weird<br>
<br>
<i>on realizing how much of a boomer I am</i><br>
<br>
This might be the last year I take math comps seriously. I don't want it to be, but this might be how it ends up.<br>
It's kind of weird knowing that people my age are applying to college.<br>
I need to grind hard this year to make USAMO... I'm going to have to do computational and oly at the same time. On top of getting all my schoolwork done. How this is going to work, I don't know. Not making TST group be like..... <img src="/assets/images/smilies/no.gif" alt=":noo:" title=":noo:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
Anyway, this will probably be the penultimate year.<br>
Where did my childhood go??<br>
<br>
It's actually very nice having a free roof to sleep under and people to cook you free meals and lots of time to just think about math</div>

			<div class="message">2 more weeks<br>
I think I’m spoiled now. I didn’t used to feel so lonely at home. I think I’m just way too used to being around ppl like me <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
I had a dream that I illegally jumped on a plane to go to mathcamp LMAO<br>
but at the last minute the flight attendant realized there was someone on the plane who wasn’t supposed to be there and I felt really bad so I turned myself in<br>
all my dreams in the past few days have involved moppers<br>
I miss you all <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

Other things that happened:
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>I have stopped doing 100% geo because mop tests have shown me that I need to get better at other subjects. So I did some combo yesterday. (But ofc as a true geo main I will still do mostly geo)</li>
<li>my discord and instagram got hacked, discord is okay now but I think I permanently lost access to my instagram account. Good excuse to force myself to get off instagram though, I used to spend way too long on there. I also got free discord nitro.</li>
<li>I did not actually take my drivers written test yet; I’m probably taking it next week. So I have a few more days to study.</li>
<li>I am now going to take AP Macro instead of APUSH next year which I think is really good for my workload</li>
<li>I have learned the power of irl socialization, and plz can HMMT be in person this year</li>

			<div class="message">Time to be alone for the next 3 weeks<br>
When mathcamp starts I’ll probably have a little fomo because a lot of very cool ppl are going to mathcamp <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">( but it’s expensive sooo<br>
I am quite excited for sparc tho<br>
mop has shown me how much fun being away from home is and now I just want to be away from home and like be free<br>
quite concerning<br>
mop has also improved my work ethic quite a bit because I got to see how hard other ppl work<br>
and I think I enjoy math more now<br>
and hopefully I will manage to maintain that work ethic for the short term until otis starts again<br>
ok my work ethic is not THAT good, I spent a few hours working on an easy problem that I could have solved much quicker yesterday. Also I want to start doing some non-geo in addition to doing geo because mop has made me realize how bad at non-geo I am.<br>
<br>
wow 2022 is half over<br>
<br>
I have to take my drivers written test maybe today cuz my mom wants to teach me to drive asap oof<br>
time to like memorize 60 things<br>
Not fun<br>
<br>
I have to do some other things too, like daily challenge work and a tiny bit of athemath work, but I’m procrastinating really badly on both of these<br>
Being at mop for a month has made me extremely detached from the outside world. I barely thought about anything concerning places outside the cmu campus for an entire month. And basically got swallowed up by the abstract world of math. I guess it’s time to exit fantasy and come back to the real world.<br>
<br>
also Rest In Peace Technoblade I have no idea who you are but when ppl die… <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>

also as u can see I have restored July 2020 css LMAO</div>

			<div class="message">Ok what the heck even happened yesterday<br>
I got 0 hours of sleep so my memory isn’t exactly the best<br>
Also note that I’m not putting usernames in bold to save time.<br>
I think ppl woke up later than usual on the morning of the 28th because they were sleeping in to prepare for the all nighter ?<br>
I ate breakfast and then went to our first class which I think was normal except a few ppl were very late (dotted and m4l were 87 and 89 minutes late respectively)<br>
We then had lunch, a guest speaker talk by 3b1b which ppl definitely didn’t troll with the chat usernames, and then the very last assembly. The entire thing was very sad. Then we had the mop picture, and then a few hours of free time before the talent show, in which I hung out with some ppl at the dorm for a while, I think we just played random games and attempted playing 4 person Secret Hitler, attended the very last singing troupe practice, and then went on a walk with like half of mop to the expii office. ppl got free t-shirts there.<br>
Then we hurriedly had dinner and went to the talent show, which was pretty rushed since there wasn’t much time, so some of the acts were skipped including the mass ftw game LOL. The talent show was very cool and funny tho, I won’t go into too much detail since it would take too long to describe everything oops.<br>
Talent show ended at 10 and then the all nighter began. Some ppl like dotted and squareman decided to actually get some sleep smh imagine. We spent the first hour at Tepper watching some of the talent show acts which had been cut from the program, including Sophie’s dance and ISL Guessing, which tiger won.<br>
Afterwards me and some other ppl decided we wanted to go outside, definitely not to break the rule of having to be inside the dorm past 10:30. We eventually convinced the RA’s that we were “only going to the backyard to get some fresh air” and succeeded in getting outside, and I watched some ppl play volleyball for quite a while. However, we wanted to go somewhere farther than just the backyard, so we talked about going to different buildings on the CMU campus and possibly even a walk in Schenley Park. Apparently such excursions are a tradition in previous irl mops.<br>
However, the group of ppl outside was quite large so eventually word got out and tapir1729 and PROA200 managed to convince the RA’s that we could go on an excursion outside within the boundaries of cmu’s campus if we had 2 TA’s with us. So we found 2 TA’s who were willing to go with us and left at 2am. (I spent the hour before that being really high and trying to play Secret Hitler with a bunch of other really high ppl which didn’t work so well). We initially went to the exam hall where we took the mop tests and tstst’s, and watched tapir1729 present part of a solution for a few minutes. But everyone was too tired to actually do math, so we went outside to the track and proceeded to do more weird things like lie down and look at the stars (ok ct was more high than me) and sing songs including some weird ones like dem deer. Eventually some ppl wanted to go back to the dorm to play sardines, so we went to the dorm around 4am but ended up not actually playing sardines. ct and ets1331 were solving Austria junior olympiad round 1 problems for some reason (we were all really really high). After a while ppl started to doze off and for the hour from 4 to 5 I mainly hung around in the singing troupe room because it was the only room with actually energetic ppl. We sang a lot of songs including some very sad ones, and the_turtle played the piano the entire time. Throughout that hour I actually became more and more awake. Then the_turtle decided to take us on a long walk to see the sunrise around 5am, so we took a 2 hour walk to some place with a nice view and took some nice pictures. I also played a few games of ftw there (apparently some ppl in the dorm had woken up). When we got back to the dorm (and I had successfully completed an all nighter) there was barely anyone in the first floor. A lot of ppl were either sleeping or packing. I was very awake but my brain was still too dead to do math, so I failed on an ez geo problem. Then I wandered around not wanting to eat breakfast just searching for other awake souls because I was in need of company.<br>
<br>
Gradually ppl began to leave in groups for the airport, which was really sad an involved a lot of emotional hugging and crying. A majority of moppers cried at some point, because how can you not be extremely sad if you just made very good friends with someone and might never see them again? I cried a bit, but probably very little so far compared to the average mopper.<br>
<br>
I played a few games of The Game with tiger and Marvin Mao and amuthup but eventually I stopped playing because it was too sad watching everyone leave. ct had to leave and that was very sad. then I packed up in like half an hour and took a 1.25 hour walk carrying 1/2 of my luggage to my house (I needed to be alone to fully process the fact that mop was over). When I got back tiger was gone, there were a ton of ppl on the first floor tho because they were scheduled to leave at noon. So we said bye to a ton of ppl and I ate some food and soon it was just a handful of ppl left (around 15 ppl had afternoon departure times). The entire thing was extremely sad and I spent a lot of time just walking around the empty and quiet dorm. 10th and 11th graders were especially sad because we didn’t know whether we could make it next year.<br>
<br>
Then I talked with my siblings and solved the geo problem I had been doing in the morning (I am now much less high than before and actually feel like I got a full night of sleep) and now I’m just watching ppl slowly leave and it’s really sad<br>
<br>
Darn, maybe never again will I be doing geo in the morning and someone will look over my shoulder and ask which problem I’m doing.<br>
Maybe never again will I play ftw on phone with horrible buzzglitches but be having tons of fun.<br>
Maybe never again will I be known as one of the aops spammer moppers.<br>
Maybe never again will I hear Henrick say “imagine so bad”<br>
Maybe never again will I see most of the people I got to know during these past few weeks.<br>
I’m gonna try as hard as possible to make mop next year because the experience is clear and memorable, the solution is clean and conceptual, because I would give anything to repeat that experience, but even if that ends up not being the case, this summer will be one I never forget.</div>

			<div class="message">I woke up at 5:30 getting 7 hours of sleep, did social media and stuff until 6:30, and then around 6:30 ppl started coming downstairs and someone realized there was a paper on the wall with the tstst statistics and tst cutoff. Apparently a whopping 33 ppl made tst. So we spent the next hour waiting for a grader to wake up so we could ask for our scores. That morning was pretty sad because a lot of ppl were very emotionally damaged when they heard their scores and what the cutoff was. I think if tst cutoffs were released after mop ended, some ppl would have gotten to enjoy the last few days of mop a lot more.<br>
<br>
I actually paid attention in the first 2 classes (Sasha and Zichao); in the second one I was kind of forced to pay attention since Zichao cold calls on me and one other person very often, and I actually learned quite a bit of combo. Then my class tried to hide the whiteboard markers and erasers in our room because the blue class was coming to raid it.<br>
Then I had lunch at resnik during which ppl were still discussing the tstst and whether tstst score stuff should have been released during mop or not. Someone brought up the good point that it’s better to learn of your tstst score in a supportive environment like mop than at home (which is sometimes not very supportive). Towards the end of lunch I heard some very strange sounds from across the room, and apparently <b>CT17</b>, <b>goodbear</b>, and some other ppl were singing a very strange song called “Dem Deer”.<br>
<br>
Then we went to class taught by Brandon Wang, during which I barely paid attention cuz I was kinda tired oops. Apparently black, blue, and red were all wreaking havoc in the red room. Then we went back to the dorm through “Luke’s shortcut” which goes through a really sus passageway with blood on the floor, and I played some fish with ppl for a few minutes but I really suck at fish because I just learned how to play.<br>
<br>
I then was kind of forced to take the revenge elmo. Most of the returners just left after a few minutes, but I stayed because <b>CT17</b> and <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b> decided they wanted to actually attempt the problems. (And they’re newcomers LMAO.) problem 1 was something squareman had posted in the problem proposals channel of ommc staff, so I had seen it before but hadn’t solved. I eventually solved problem 4 because it was actually really easy. I spent the rest of the 2 hours I was there just watching other ppl because very interesting things were happening in the room. <b>DottedCaculator</b> and <b>rjiangbz</b> were live grading, <b>cocohearts</b> was randomly saying ways to cheese problems, groupsolving was happening on the chalkboard, and <b>goodbear</b> found a way to play “Dem Deer” on the lecture hall speakers and got a lot of ppl to sing along. It was a very interesting experience but it would be pretty unfortunate if Dem Deer got stuck in my head, which is probably going to happen ngl.<br>
Then I went to resnik for dinner (imagine not resnik), and very few ppl were there because most ppl are tired of resnik by now. The food isnt actually that bad though, except for the broccoli. Towards the end we got bored so <b>CT17</b> had the great idea of zoom bombing the SSMO Closing Ceremony. None of us wanted to actually do it though so eventually <b>ETS1331</b> and I joined on our phones. I raised my hand and we eventually got unmuted; then <b>Math4Life2020</b> started yelling stuff and the rest of us said random stuff but we were mainly laughing at <b>Math4Life2020</b>. I kinda felt bad after doing that cuz we had just crashed their closing ceremony, but basically everyone else thought it was really funny. Then we went back to the dorm and there was a high stakes ping pong match going on downstairs. Then I went to the second to last singing troupe practice, and since there were no more activities I went to sleep at 9:30 (to catch up on sleep for the all nighter tonight).<br>
<br>
Darn, today is the last day of mop… so sad that it’s ending but thx yall for the amazing experiences!!!!<br>
Happy tau day</div>

			<div class="message">tldr; I didn’t make tst group<br>
Distrib: 000 006 700<br>
I got only geo problems basically<br>
<br>
Day 1:<br>
<br>
I decided to attempt the geo first. I found a quadrilateral I thought was cyclic (P_AHMQ_A if H, M are the foot from A to BC and the midpoint of BC) and spent a long time struggling to prove this. Turns out I never managed to prove it. I didn’t really know how to finish from there because I didn’t construct the point which would prove the concyclity (which was pretty much needed to solve the problem) and also didn’t know Jacobi theorem exists (more on that later). So I basically struggled on problem 2 for a few hours thinking that I was close when I actually wasn’t really. Then when there were like 1.5 hours left I finally decided to look at problem 1. It was a combo problem which looked not bad, but I was so wrong. I eventually found a complete fakesolve and even got the wrong answer, and I spent the last ~half hour trying to attempt problem 2 again. By now I had much less faith in my ability to solve it so I was pretty much dead. I wrote up my progress, basically just the cyclic quadrilateral thing and that it was provable with “spiral similarity” (which it was, but I didn’t show how).<br>
Then afterwards I realized I had gotten the wrong answer for problem 1, but a lot of ppl were saying they had fakesolved. Apparently it was a very fakesolvable problem and almost all of mop fakesolved. That night a lot of ppl were mad at <b>The_Turtle</b> (the author of that problem) since they had gotten swept that day and so Tilted Students Thoroughly Splash Turtle happened. So yeah I got swept by that day, and so did a majority of mop (well some ppl got partials on problem 1 for almost getting the right construction)<br>
<br>
Day 2:<br>
<br>
I was pretty nervous for this day. I looked at the problems, and problem 6 was geo while the other two weren’t. So I made the extremely big brain decision of spending the entire time on problem 6. Literally the entire time. After like 2 hours I hadn’t solved it but I had gotten 90% of the way there (the rest was trivial by Jacobi theorem) but I didn’t know this because I didn’t know Jacobi theorem despite it also showing up on problem 2. Oh well. So I spent the rest of the time trying to prove this fact which was trivial by Jacobi. I ended up almost complex bashing it but not quite having time to finish because I’m bad at complex bash. So the day ended with me having fully solved no questions. I had spent a total of 1 minute on problems 4 and 5, just enough time to read them. Well turns out this “see geo and do it” strat wasn’t working very well.<br>
Apparently a ton of people solved problem 4 and quite a few solved problem 5, so spending the whole time on problem 6 wasn’t exactly the best idea, oops. In fact it was a really stupid idea. I ended up somehow getting 6 points for problem 6 because I had gotten up to the point where it was trivial by Jacobi…<br>
<br>
Day 3:<br>
<br>
Okay I was very very nervous for this day. I thought it was possibly my last chance at having a shot at egmo 2023. So I had to solve 2 problems or something. Since there had not been an easy geo yet, problem 7 was predicted to be geo. And it was, except I took a shockingly long time to solve it - 2 and a half hours. FTR dotted solved it in 20 minutes (but he’s just built different). I’m stupid. So I solved it and wrote it up and then tried to do stuff on problem 8, but I’m bad so I didn’t really get anywhere and also my brain was dead. So I thought rip, there goes all of my goals…<br>
Turns out problem 7 was pretty hard and only like half of mop got it, and problem 8 was pretty hard too.<br>
<br>
So yeah I ended up with 14-eps points depending on partials, and missed tst group by 2.  But I wasn’t expecting to be anywhere near tst group qualification anyways since cutoff was predicted to be around 21. Also the fact that I didn’t qualify means Jessica and Kristie auto qualified for egmo 2023, which is good (at most 2 girls can auto qualify). And it’s not like I have a chance at imo/rmm teams either, so idrc.<br>
<br>
so yeah rip but oh well, now I have motivation to do math for the next few months so that I actually don’t fail the egmo tst’s<br>
<br>
Congrats to everyone who made tst group!!!!!</div>

			<div class="message">basically a free day<br>
I woke up at 5:30, went on social media and ate breakfast, then did some geo<br>
around 8 ppl started waking up bc we were leaving for Kennywood at 10. I visited a slumber party containing a lot of blue moppers and that orz friend group, apparently they had been there since 2 am, and I tried to do some elmo grading and coordination but failed the second part since I’m not very good at coordination and graders are strict. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
Then <b>CT17</b>, <b>amuthup</b>, <b>goodbear</b>, <b>AI216</b>,  <b>Rico</b>, and I played One Night Werewolf and more ppl joined later<br>
We left for Kennywood at 10. The bus was very crowded which was fun. At Kennywood the part of my group which was willing to go on roller coasters went on a few roller coasters and a lot of rides. It was my first time going to an amusement park. The first roller coaster was nice, the second one was a bit scary, and basically all the other ones were fun, except the bumper cars which I failed. I didn’t go on the water one because I didn’t want to get went oops. I did see <b>SpinTop</b> and chatted with her for a few minutes and we went on one ride together! Hopefully I’ll get to hang out with her more sometime.<br>
Our group was led by <b>ETS1331</b> since he is tall and clearly an adult, and we managed to lose <b>Math4Life2020</b> who didn’t have a phone, eventually he was found by an actual adult. Then we went back on the bus which was much less crowded than on the way here; it was much like a roller coaster in that you had to hold on and it swayed back and forth. <b>CT17</b>, <b>hliu1</b>, <b>nihao4112</b>, <b>Marvin</b>, and I attempted some of <b>tapir1729</b>’s mock countdown round problems that he wrote in middle school and some ppl were actually able to solve stuff mentally without looking at the problem, how so good.<br>
Then I played Mao with <b>DottedCaculator</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>CT17</b>, <b>AI216</b>, <b>bluelinfish</b> and some of them made the worst rules ever because imagine being a nt main and making everything about high level nt.<br>
Then we went to dinner at the dining hall because imagine going out to eat. Resnik food is not too bad (except for the broccoli and some other stuff). And it’s also free.<br>
There was like no one else at Resnik.<br>
We spammed a certain discord gc on dotted’s computer.<br>
I went to tepper after dinner to attempt elmo coordination again which didn’t work very well<br>
I learned that there is something going on between <b>Eyed</b>, <b>PieAreSquared</b>, and <b>hliu1</b>.<br>
Then I went to possibly the last office hours ever <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> and didn’t go to singing troupe because it was too late already. I slept at 10:30.<br>
<br>
Only 2 more days <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
I won’t discuss the tstst until I get my score back which is either today or tomorrow</div>

			<div class="message">No more mop tests, possibly ever for me. (Well except for the revenge elmo but that doesn’t really count)<br>
Will talk about tstst 3 later. Why am I so bad.<br>
It was Saturday so I woke up at 6 and ate food and attempted doing geo. I also went on a 20 minute bike ride. <b>amuthup</b> and I tried to length bash a problem using linpop, and almost finished. We then played “The Mind” with a lot of other ppl, which is actually a very interesting and fun game. Around 10 am ppl slowly woke up (bruh), and we went to play Secret Hitler. I’m finally starting to get the hang of this game. Then we went to brunch and idk what we did until 1:00 but I was playing ftw with some ppl and the Clapping Troupe (led by <b>goodbear</b> and <b>nihao4112</b>) was having an impromptu practice. And we may have been doing some geo to practice.<br>
Then tstst 3 happened.<br>
Then we had dinner during which we were basically just talking about tstst problems the whole time.<br>
Then test review happened; there weren’t many ppl at test review. Probably because a lot of ppl were getting food at other places (imagine not just eating at Resnik).<br>
One of the graders was late so everyone wrote “Franklyn, you’re late” a billion times on the billion chalkboards.<br>
We then walked to Tepper for a “special assembly” which was really just a random birthday celebration bruh. There was impromptu singing troupe practice for like an hour while we waited. Also, <b>Vincent</b> wrote a really bad parody of “A Million Dreams” which does not have the most pro-geometry lyrics so I changed it to say the opposite. But unfortunately <b>Vincent</b>’s parody is more popular than mine.<br>
I think there was also some sort of tag game going on so ppl were chasing each other outside. I went to bed at 10:20 cuz I’m a good child jk I just get tired early<br>
Today is literally such a free day; we are going to Kennywood (amusement park) in small groups and idk what we’re doing for the rest of the day. But I will see <b>SpinTop</b> at Kennywood and I’m really excited!<br>
<br>
There are 3 more days of mop… <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
I think maybe I should not hang out with the same ppl all the time since I should really try to get to know as many ppl as possible in the small bit remaining of mop.. but we’ll see. Hanging out with ppl is hard oops<br>
I can’t believe mop is almost over, but all good things have to come to an end<br>
And irl mop is one of those things where to have it happen even once in a lifetime is already a huge blessing</div>

			<div class="message">this was quite an eventful day<br>
so first something happened related to the tstst which made me really sad (but it was kinda my fault) so I kinda had a mental breakdown<br>
and didn’t really talk the entire first class (Olha’s)<br>
I eventually got over it tho, so the second class was normal<br>
the second class was taught by <b>The_Turtle</b> and <b>anser</b> and was basically a bunch of “math puzzles” most of which were trolly olympiad questions; they were really fun<br>
at the beginning of class, my class just decided to clap for <b>The_Turtle</b> and <b>anser</b> for 5 minutes straight; we only stopped when <b>The_Turtle</b> made us stop. Then he told us a story of how moppers had clapped for a teacher for 45 minutes straight in the past, and we decided to try and beat that after class. So after class we clapped for 46 minutes straight while walking to lunch and eating lunch. My hands got very red but it was worth it. And the mop clapping troupe began (<b>goodbear</b> and <b>nihao4112</b> decided to clap to the beat of never gonna give you up).<br>
Then we had another class, by Michael, on kinda trolly problems called “True/False”. A lot of the problems were well known but it was still really fun. Certain ppl were making jokes and being loud the entire class though, so at the end Michael made us work in silence for the last 5 minutes.<br>
Then I could have gone to Milan’s geo bashing lecture but decided not to. Instead I did Ukrainian geo problems synthetically with <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b> and <b>CT17</b>. Then we played Secret Hitler with a lot of other ppl, and I tried out the very bad strategy of acting Fascist when I’m Liberal and vice versa. It didnt work very well because I lost every time.<br>
Then I went to Chipotle with <b>Eyed</b>, <b>CT17</b>, <b>amuthup</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b>, and <b>goodbear</b>. It was my first time going to Chipotle. Some ppl were talking about and actually trying to think about apfmo problems. Then the conversation devolved into discussion of extremely troll problems which ppl used wolfram alpha to think of and solve. We then went back to the dorm but went through a building on the way and ended up staying in that building to groupsolve geo and throw erasers for 1 hour. We eventually came back to the dorm just in time for the last few minutes of Sasha’s seminar and singing troupe.<br>
Singing troupe was fun. Afterwards I lost and found my ID card, and something else related to the tstst made me much happier and cancelled out the thing that happened in the morning. I went to bed at 10 because tstst day 3 is today, rip.</div>

			<div class="message">Summary of things that happened on 6/22 and 6/23:<br>
Yesterday there was a lot of free time so I played a lot of Secret Hitler with some ppl in the afternoon<br>
I also went to singing troupe and spectated a very interesting water balloon and water gun fight which involved like half of mop<br>
It was basically the pro-Holden ppl against the anti-Holden ppl and I haven’t quite decided what side im on yet<br>
Today I mainly spent the entire day being nervous and I also went on a 2 hour bike ride in the morning on which I almost got lost like 5 times<br>
We did have a nice class on triangle geo in the morning tho<br>
I need to actually stop being stupid<br>
<br>
Will talk about [stuff I’m not allowed to talk about] later<br>
<br>
edit: ok im slightly less dead now<br>
not much happened last night except for test review and staying in the test review room until 10:45 to groupsolve problems with <b>CircleInvert</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>CT17</b> (first we did geo, and then we did nt and I wasn’t able to contribute much because I am trash at nt LOL)<br>
I seriously need to get better at non geo</div>

			<div class="message">uh yeah what happened yesterday<br>
I woke up at 5:15 and typed a rly long blog post and then went biking and then continued to work on a geo problem from <b>tapir1729</b>’s mock tstst which I didn’t end up solving but got close<br>
ppl actually woke up early cuz they had slept early<br>
we then had breakfast and ran to class in 5 minutes, first class was combo geo which was pretty cool<br>
certain ppl in my class were being rly loud tho and even the teacher was cracking up<br>
then we had zichao’s class on algebra which was really really hard and I think zichao way overestimated our math ability (except like <b>DottedCaculator</b>) maybe he thought we were as good as kids in Chinese training camps or smth<br>
certain ppl were playing cookie clicker during that class lol<br>
then everyone proceeded to freak out during lunch about the fact that tstst day 1 was next. <b>CT17</b> was probably doing some mock tstst problems again.<br>
then came the tstst. no discuss.<br>
almost everything that happened later that night was based on events of the tstst so I guess we don’t talk about that<br>
I did go to storytime tho, hence why I went to bed late (at 10:45)</div>

			<div class="message">tho I kinda doubt that will happen cuz…<br>
tstst’s are this week.<br>
anyway time for daily posts<br>
I woke up at 6 yesterday and went downstairs to find <b>Sophie</b> dancing. I checked social media and then started to do elmo shortlist geo. <b>CT17</b> soon came down and started to do Japan MO problems. We were soon joined by I think <b>Boxcars2015</b>, <b>Eyed</b>, <b>Inconsistent</b>, <b>amuthup</b>? I kinda forget. Since the dining hall was closed we ate cancer and breakfast food for breakfast at the dorm, while doing geo problems. Then we went to our first class which was Inversion! The first actual synthetic geo class. Of course <b>DottedCaculator</b> and <b>Math4Life2020</b> arrived late. The problems were kinda classic but fun, especially the ending ones. Then we had “Number Theory” class, in which we saw very interesting proofs of some theorems and then “groupsolved” a few problems. (Imagine being good at number theory though) At the end, we saw a really really cool proof of Lucas’s theorem. Then we went to lunch and the dining hall was not on fire. I don’t really remember what happened during lunch but <b>Math4Life2020</b> probably said something stupid. Then we hurried to the assembly at 1:20, in which we saw the schedule for the next week, a few announcements were made, and <b>Math4Life2020</b> said a lot of stupid things, such as “do we have to take money out of our pockets?” (referring to the tstst). <b>CT17</b>, <b>ETS1331</b>, and I played some ftw instead of paying attention. We also got tstst ID’s, which were all divisors of 210^infinity. Then we had a sponsor talk from a startup called RAMP. The speaker guy was very charismatic, according to <b>Sophie</b>. They asked us some very interesting questions, such as which 2 we would choose to defend ourselves and the rest would attack us, out of a certain group of 9 animals. There were a lot of jokes about software engineers because the presenters were both software engineers. At the end when they were trying to convince us all to intern at RAMP (you have to be at least around college freshman age), <b>Math4Life2020</b> asked if he could intern at 14. Then we did a Covid test and fortunately everyone found a one-liner, according to <b>CT17</b>?? (I think). Then since we had been sitting in lecture hall seats for 2 hours, we went to <b>tapir1729</b>’s talk on Length Bashing and sat in lecture hall seats for another 2 hours. Not that many ppl were there because there were a lot of other events going on, such as <b>Edward</b>’s panel and probably some games of Secret Hitler. The talk was quite interesting; we learned the area method, linearity of PoP, and probably other stuff that I am forgetting. <b>CT17</b> and <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b> were playing cookie clicker the entire time (and probably half paying attention too) and in the middle, <b>rjiangbz</b> who was sitting behind us just said really loudly “<b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b> just hit 1 million cookies!” He made it even more funny by saying “he must have a lot of browser tabs open”. <b>tapir1729</b> also told the story of doing sohcahtoa wrong and getting a 6 on an imo problem, and the “imagine so cahtoa” meme was born. <b>Math4Life2020</b> was there, so of course stupid questions were asked, such as whether or not there was free food at the imo. Maybe this is why it took 2 hours. Then we went to dinner, during which we were trying to do geo but <b>Math4Life2020</b> decided to be Gordon Ramsey and “cook” by dumping sugar packets into water. Everyone started quoting and pinging him in #quote-log because he was saying some very interesting things, so <b>Math4Life2020</b> said “I love being pinged, because it makes me feel important”. He then got mass pinged by a bunch of people. <b>rjiangbz</b> thought of a bunch of acronyms for “TSTST”. We then went to a “seminar” titled “the graders’ favorite problems” which was kind of a scam because they just presented a bunch of problems and only one solution. But it was still interesting. Then there was singing troupe run by <b>The_Turtle</b>. He announced the songs we would be singing for the talent show, and then we practiced some of them: A Million Dreams, Defying Gravity, Into The Unknown, Music Of The Night. The third one is hard because I don’t know it. Singing troupe ended a little after 9, so I went to <b>Espen</b>’s room to grab my (and <b>PieAreSquared</b>’s, and <b>Isabella</b>’s, and <b>Kristie</b>’s) ELMO team’s day 2 submissions and scanned them. Then I took a shower and went to sleep at 9:45 because tstst day 1 is today…..<br>
<br>
also in this post, “we” is usually me and [the other aops spammers], minus <b>Math4Life2020</b> because he’s too much of a spammer<br>
<br>
darn that took wayyyy longer to type up than expected LOL maybe I should not put unnecessary detail next time</div>

			<div class="message">I am currently watching some ppl troll on aops during lunch<br>
Look at hso or c&amp;p if u are wondering<br>
<br>
We also had improv a few days ago and I was in the group with all the “troll ppl” so we turned everything into a subject preference debate or an orzfest<br>
<br>
I have been groupsolving geo with some ppl in the mornings (<b>CT17</b>, <b>amuthup</b>, <b>Eyed</b>, and sometimes other ppl like <b>ETS1331</b>, <b>hliu1</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b> when they wake up early)<br>
<br>
I wonder where <b>Eyed</b>’s hat is<br>
<br>
I am somehow maintaining a 10-6 sleep schedule<br>
<br>
<b>CT17</b> decided to choose random countries and do MO and TST problems from them so we have been doing some very high quality problems (and posting very high quality solutions on aops)<br>
<br>
The puzzle hunt is currently ongoing and we (<b>CT17</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b>) haven’t gotten far but yesterday we did luke’s puzzle hunt thing, the first part was math which we somehow managed to do (I got lucky by getting an ez problem), the second part was an impossible crossword, the third part was a country thing that <b>DottedCaculator</b> carried, and the fourth part was a code thing and then a sudoku (we definitely did the code part).<br>
<br>
<b>pad</b> has decided to randomly go “dotted orz” whenever he sees dotted which is actually really funny<br>
<br>
Yesterday we played spike ball which was very hard and I failed<br>
<br>
I also got trolled by <b>rjiangbz</b> and <b>Espen</b>’s not fun ctional equation<br>
<br>
Have not died in mafia yet<br>
<br>
TSTST’s start in 2 days D:</div>

			<div class="message">Well this week has been very light on classes maybe because next week is tstst??<br>
We didn’t have afternoon class the day before yesterday so I played secret hitler for a way too long lol<br>
We had 2 math talks by mathematicians yesterday and we have something called “philosophy” this afternoon<br>
I finally got bug spray<br>
The fire alarm went off in the dining hall yesterday so we ate free breakfast food at the dorm<br>
We had like 2 tests in the past 3 days can’t discuss tho aaaa<br>
And a mysterious Covid test yesterday D:<br>
It’s like 95 degrees<br>
<b>DottedCaculator</b> counted from 40 to 20 in english and chinese yesterday to get a free math book<br>
I’ve been playing ftw at meals and while waiting for assemblies to start with <b>CT17</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b>, and yesterday <b>hliu1</b> even joined !<br>
Because clearly ftw prepares us for oly tests like elmo, mimo, and tstst<br>
I got trolled by a lot of anti problems in the past week<br>
8 hrs of sleep two days in a row so I’m actually not horribly tired anymore<br>
I have decided to go to sleep instead of attending storytime which gets me considerably more sleep<br>
last time I went to storytime we got ambushed by some ppl throwing water balloons lol<br>
Evan Chen geo class today!! Yay!!<br>
<br>
Why do all the mop instructors hate geo and never teach geo and then every test has geo on it</div>

			<div class="message">nooo lets not think about how much has passed<br>
<br>
some things that happened in the past 2 days:<br>
we had no classes since it was the weekend; hence lots of free time and doing very little math and not knowing where ppl are etc.<br>
we played this very mafia-like game about liberals and fascists and literally everything said was taken out of contest and put in quote-log<br>
let’s not talk about mimo or mimo coordination<br>
me being unable to do anything except geo<br>
more ftw games with <b>CT17</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b> at the most random places like at the cafeteria or lecture hall<br>
attempting to call as many moppers by their aops usernames as possible because we are so immature<br>
singing troupe; somehow half of mop was there<br>
seminar and office hours/storytime which were pretty fun except it was outside so I got 9374934 bug bites<br>
climbing through the window very fun<br>
live action mafia game has started and it’s intense. prob gonna die soon :clown: also I don’t know how half of the rules work<br>
I think I got the most sleep I’ve gotten so far last night; 7 hours straight??<br>
test 2 today D:</div>

			<div class="message">Like is this actually real life<br>
I would take a tstst every day to stay here forever<br>
Some things that happened in the past 2 days:<br>
<br>
More mop classes; mostly pretty fun<br>
2 sigma talk which was kinda boring<br>
First mop test was yesterday, [redacted stuff]<br>
I got an otis shirt from evan yesterday <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> I also succeeded in doing laundry<br>
I did geo problems with <b>CT17</b>, <b>squareman</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b>, <b>CyclicISLscelesTrapezoid</b>, <b>bluelinfish</b>, etc for hours today lmao (imagine being able to write good problems)<br>
Basically a lot of ppl here that are well known on aops lol<br>
How is everyone so good at math<br>
I also played ftw for a rly long time yesterday and today with <b>CT17</b>, <b>DottedCaculator</b>, <b>nihao4112</b>, <b>V_Enhance</b>, <b>laura.yingyue.zhang</b>, <b>ETS1331</b>, <b>bluelinfish</b>, <b>amuthup</b>, <b>CircleInvert</b>, <b>Math4Life2020</b>, <b>hliu_1</b>, and maybe more ppl that I forgot, how is evan so good at ftw lol<br>
Playing ftw on phone is hard and so is writing blogposts<br>
I think dotted said “so bad” at least 200 times today<br>
Mock imo is tomorrow and I also have to finish solving elmo 2022 problems aaaa<br>
<br>
I’m not getting enough sleep only like 6 hours a night LOL (approx 10 to 4) I think it is slowly becoming a problem because today I was so tired at 7am I went on a bike ride to wake myself up, and then almost fell asleep a couple times throughout the day<br>
Also I was barely able to do geo when I woke up because my brain wasn’t working for some reason<br>
Maybe I will sleep in tonight<br>
<br>
A lot of ppl are doing this name tag switching thing and when I checked in tonight they actually marked the person on my name tag instead of me lol<br>
<br>
I think this month will very likely be the best month of my life<br>
<br>
I think being in an environment where everyone around you works hard is very motivating to work hard lol</div>

			<div class="message">I survived the first day of mop classes<br>
somehow it feels like it’s been more than 1 day lol<br>
mop test today… D:<br>
I first did some geo when I woke up, then I illegally biked to my house, then I watched <b>CT17</b> and <b>EW</b> groupsolve a homework problem while being half asleep<br>
then breakfast and classes which were quite interesting<br>
how are ppl so good<br>
then lunch (btw the food is actually kinda good) and another class<br>
then an elmo meeting that took 3 hours and was basically just ppl arguing about wording<br>
(let’s go Isabella Zhu Fanclub!!)<br>
then I awkwardly followed some op ppl to dinner and there wasn’t anything scheduled after dinner so me and <b>CT17</b> and <b>squareman</b> spent a while trying to get name tags back from <b>math4life2020</b> bruh moment<br>
then I hung out with <b>CT17</b>, <b>squareman</b>, <b>amuthup</b>, <b>Gogobao</b> and some other ppl and groupsolved a problem (I don’t contribute much to groupsolves tho)<br>
then I went on a walk with <b>The_Turtle</b>, <b>janabel</b>, <b>VH</b>, <b>EB</b>, <b>EW</b>, <b>RW</b> to a boba shop but half of us didn’t get boba lol<br>
then I went to the 2nd floor lounge to do geo with <b>CT17</b> and <b>squareman</b> (and <b>KW</b> came in for a bit) and then went to sleep<br>
<br>
Random but I feel like there’s intense competition among some of the pink moppers for the last ~2 spots on the egmo team for next year<br>
Like several ppl are just grinding in their rooms 24/7 lol<br>
And I’m probably grinding the least bc I may look like I’m grinding but really I’m just doing geo problems for fun <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
I keep seeing the security guard at 4am and fortunately he doesn’t do anything other than give me weird looks<br>
<br>
Until mop I’d never been in a situation where I wasn’t one of the most mathy ppl<br>
it feels so weird and so amazing</div>

			<div class="message">actual arml recap<br>
<br>
so with respect to my team, this entire experience was really interesting and way different than expected bc at all of our previous arml practices everyone kinda hung out with the few ppl they knew there<br>
but by the end of the trip, our team ACTUALLY bonded like we all became pretty good friends (except maybe one group of a few highschoolers) like it was actually pretty mindblowing; i would never have expected<br>
anyway, first we spent the 3 hour bus ride there not really doing much; i was introduced to the whale which was our team mascot the entire time; near the end me and my friends decided to annoy the highschoolers in the back by playing annoying songs; this backfired bc later some middle schooler decided to play rickroll whenever he got the chance to<br>
when we finally got there we were apparently following the central jersey bus so I instantly saw <b>caroline2023</b> it was kind of awkward cuz we were both staring at each other not exactly knowing if each other was the correct person...<br>
then we checked in put stuff in our dorms and then played in the games room with BCA ppl (oh yea and our shirts look almost exactly like the BCA ppls' shirts so we blend in perfectly)<br>
then I saw the TJ team (PROOOOOOOOO) including <b>Isabella Zhu</b>, <b>laura.yingyue.zhang</b>, <b>Michelle Kang</b>, <b>SmartZX</b>, etc<br>
then me and my friends decided to go to the creamery (we saw <b>overlord123</b>'s little brother there all by himself and were kinda concerned) and then went back to the games room to play mafia and cards (this is where we finally started actually <i>getting to know</i> other ppl on our team)<br>
then we had dinner at chipotle (and saw one of the TJ teams AGAIN) and went to the talk at 8; we ran into LHS team playing frisbee and I saw <b>kevinmathz</b>, <b>luminescent</b>, <b>azduncan</b>, <b>Zorger74</b>, <b>Boxcars2015</b>, <b>jeangreyphoenix</b> etc.<br>
then some of my friends and I went to the song contest and started playing cards???? because we didn't want to sing. I saw <b>caroline2023</b> again and the TJ ppl AGAIN and some BCA ppl like <b>Autumn Shin</b>. I also saw <b>sargamsujit</b>!!!!<br>
<b>overlord123</b> got lost lol<br>
we went to bed around 10:30 and I woke up at 5, attempted the g2mathprogram app problems for a bit and pretty much failed, then we went to breakfast and I saw a tonnn of ppl such as <b>I-_-I</b><br>
a lot of time was spent wandering around not really doing much<br>
also my team is kinda weird and decides to randomly shout our coach's name, which is "Elizabeth Fengmei Chang-Davidson", at random times<br>
anyways for the actual contest:<br>
the team round is ok, I only did #2 and 9 and I don't even know if i got them both right... we prob sillied a bunch lol<br>
the power round is mediocre except i'm dumb so I didn't understand the part beyond #8 very well and could not contribute much to that section <img src="/assets/images/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":|" title=":|" class="bbcode_smiley"> this is where it starts to get bad<br>
the individual rounds are pretty darn bad. I first blundered #4 (thought there were 9 sections not 11) which I thought would give me motivation to try even harder but it backfired and I got #5 five seconds <i>after</i> time was called; i forgot to sqrt the 2022<br>
by that point i figured i was pretty much screwed so i continued to get exactly 1 right on all the remaining sets for a trash score of 6 (imo)<br>
pretty sad that my arml score has barely increased over the years<br>
relay was okay i guess; i got pretty ez problems lmao<br>
oh yea also WWP was sitting behind us so I saw <b>pbj2006</b> but didn't say hi cuz i was kinda shy oops<br>
but hi pbj.<br>
and i also think i saw <b>andyxpandy99</b> but again am kinda shy lmao<br>
i did say hi to <b>ApraTrip</b> tho.<br>
dangggg good job to everyone who made tiebreakers tho yall are absolute geniuses (esp sargam absolute genius) and we had fun watching the absolute geniuses sit at tables in the front of the room and do problems<br>
also it was really funny this kid who was on the PA mathcounts team this yr joined our team at the last minute so he was put on the B team but he literally did better than everyone on the A team<br>
anyways that's basically it that happened; on the bus ride back we played a huge game of mafia because like I said my team actually bonded through the journey. kinda sad that I won't be seeing any of them for 3 months but it'll be even longer than that until I see some of the other ppl i saw again, so...<br>
I will not see Elizabeth Fengmei Chang-Davidson or the whale for another 3 months <img src="/assets/images/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":|" title=":|" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-one-five"><i>am I getting worse at math?</i></span><br>
like seriously this is an actually serious question<br>
they always say to learn skills that are non-math but how can I learn skills that are non-math when I can't even stay decent level at math LOL<br>
i better not be getting worse at math.</div>

			<div class="message">my priorities are really wrong<br>
<br>
1. managing the TA server<br>
2. doing random isl geo problems<br>
3. being really active on a ton of discord servers, and checking instagram and aops multiple times a day oOps<br>
4. pondering about life<br>
5. homework<br>
6. testsolving random stuff<br>
7. mop hw, g2mathprogram app, and other math stuff I should actually be doing<br>
<br>
ARML IN 9 DAYS I CAN'T WAITTTTT like actually cant wait lol<br>
<br>
doing geometry is kind of like cracking an egg<br>
each time you crack it part of it falls off: a point/line was deleted or the entire thing was turned upside down, inverted or defined differently or the reference triangle/object was changed<br>
<b>whatever it is, the new diagram is simpler/more manageable by a little bit</b><br>
after you crack it enough times, the problem becomes only a bare skeleton of what it used to be, without all the extra stuff that was added to make it pretty, and it is now really easily solvable with only like a bit of angle chasing<br>
i'm not even a pro geometer this is just how I attack geo problems<br>
<br>
it was the seniors' last day at school today and idk how I feel, it hasn't quite hit me that I will probably never see 90% of them again and that these ppl who are only a few yrs older than me are graduating and that next year i'll be a rising <i>senior</i>. idk. like this is not happening, right??<br>
<br>
school is literally a joke tho, we barely do anything in any classes, like it seems for everyone else the last few weeks of school are the busiest well haha i'm literally the least busy ive been this entire year, by far...<br>
I have like a project or essay or lab or something in every class but they're literally so ez I'm gonna procrastinate and still finish everything thats how ez it is/// ok prob overconfident but u get the point<br>
<br>
I know im trying less hard with math now that otis yr vii is over, but how much less exactly... I know I'm not waking up at 5am every day or staying up till 10 to do math or actually focusing 100% when I <i>am</i> doing math, so I'm def putting in less <i>time</i><br>
but also, a good portion of the otis problems I was doing before weren't very hard for me, maybe thats how I was able to do so many "problems" (but the harder problems were very hard ofc) and now im doing almost 100% "hard problems". and I used to get a lot of hints on the "hard" problems in otis so I guess I didn't try quite as hard on my own<br>
but also, these days I do basically only geo and I used to actually do other subjects during otis, which I should really get back to... only being able to do 1 subject which is dying is not a good idea<br>
the biggest thing I miss about otis days is having nonzero skill at combo, tho I had very close to zero. but now I actually have zero because of lack of practice <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">. I kinda miss giraffe theory ngl, that was kinda cool...<br>
so idk. I think I am having more "fun" nowadays but less "fulfillment". because geo is the definition of fun, ofc. whatever, fun for 1/2 of the year and fulfillment for the other 1/2 is not bad I guess</div>

			<div class="message">lol my arml practice feels like complete clownery compared to the actually good teams<br>
today was power round practice:<br>
3:30: power rounds get handed out, the A team and B team get combined because not enough ppl show up to practice, some 6th grader shouts that they cant find Decartes' Circle Theorem on the paper, half of the middle schoolers complain that they cant do proofs<br>
3:30 - 4:30: some ppl actually do problems so we get 6 problems done, 3 of which I did. some high schoolers are talking about chemistry really loudly in the back and the middle schoolers are talking about AP classes. half of the team is pretty much doing nothing.<br>
4:30 - 5:00: pizza break at FOUR THIRTY PM and we play lots of sporcle quizzes. the coach is this rly rly chill CMU gradstudent btw.<br>
5:00 - 6:00: next power round, this time we are actually split into A team and B team, the few ppl on the A team that actually try have seen this power round many times before LMAO its the one about the cities and the V_3(n). literally just me and one other kid work on the first 8 problems (this kid is also kinda weird and throws peppers in the trash can) while the other ppl fool around, then some other kids come to work on #9 and 10 with us; both problems are literally complete jokes lol. Someone on A team decided to go help B team and I think they did 90% of the work turned in by B team.<br>
so yeah!! really looking forward to arml tho<br>
<br>
I also went to mbmt on saturday cuz my brother was participating<br>
life is hectic but wonderful</div>

			<div class="message">no one pays attention to you anymore<br>
no one cares about each other’s accomplishments or lives unless they’re that persons friend<br>
my sister’s in elementary school and whenever she talks about her class in school it seems so connected. Like everyone is part of a gang or family. You look at a class in a high school or college and no one knows anything about the life of the person they’re sitting next to<br>
<br>
I really really miss that community aspect for some reason, maybe because back in 5th grade it wasn’t so obvious that I didn’t have friends because everyone was everyone else’s “friend” but now, having no friends just feels really alone, like you actually have no friends<br>
<br>
The unfortunate part is, however sad it is now it’ll only get sadder later<br>
I’m like semi friends with a group of like 10 ppl right now, kinda like I was semi friends with my whole class back in elementary school<br>
But in 2 years any sense of kinship that I may have right now with them might just dissipate like my relationships with my whole 5th grade class have dissipated throughout the past 5 years<br>
<br>
I very badly want to be in second grade again<br>
<br>
also on the topic of friends my parents are basically forcing my brother to break off from almost all of his friends because they’re “useless”<br>
no wonder I don’t have any friends.. kinda hard to if u don’t spend any time outside of school with them I guess<br>
<br>
well actually I have like exactly 1 friend at school who came in 8th grade and at that time wanted to “fit in” so she was very sad when she initially didn’t have friends but over time she’s become satisfied with being a nerd it’s very interesting<br>
I’m happy such a transition can even exist because 99% of the time it’s the opposite<br>
<br>
one of my goals is to have enough going on in my head that I can sit still for 5 minutes and not do anything but not be bored</div>

I saw luminescent and ivyzheng and kevinmathz and selena ge and a lot of other cracked people<br>
this cracked 4th grader who was on my team 2 yrs ago placed<br>
on sunday we visited our cousins who live in boston, there is an almost 3 yr old and a 6 month old so they are veryyy smol<br>
both nights I slept at midnight because we were not able to sleep any earlier and I learned how to sleep basically anywhere (in the newark airport, for example)<br>
<br>
everythign is getting blurrier I think my vision is getting worse this is scary<br>
<br>
kinda scared that I might forget how to do everything except geo</div>

			<div class="message">for some reason, of all the geo isl problems ive done, the "highest numbered ones" are all ones ive done from otis units<br>
despite "higher numbers" not necessarily correlating with difficulty<br>
maybe bc I am less scared of say, a 5 pointer on an otis unit, than a random g 5<br>
but if someone told me it was easy I would have much more motivation to solve it and try harder, even if it wasnt actually easy<br>
so I need to get rid of my psychological fears<br>
weird stuff<br>
<br>
I am so so so happy to be able to forget all of european history and calc bc for the rest of my life!!!!<br>
no more ap's school very relaxing no more stress nothing at all!!<br>
no homework even!!<br>
and my classes dont even have finals<br>
<br>
good job to everyone on mathcounts nationals!!</div>

			<div class="message">I woke up on Wednesday morning feeling like I had lost the game. In a general sense. There is no better way to describe the feeling; maybe this was a combination of my recent lack of productivity and the fact that I had semi-consciously woken up at 2 that morning to check greed control to find that I hadn’t done too well, and the fact that my right eye was a very tiny bit swollen.<br>
But anyway, these days I kind of feel like I have, in some way, lost, or, in some way, am in the process of losing. the game. :upside_down_smile:<br>
Huge really bad impending doom is coming because ap exams are coming up. I tried to cram a years worth of ap euro into a week, since I didn’t really pay attention in class, and I watched 50 episodes of crash course european history in 4 days, except I still only feel like I know 50% of the material and now I’m just kinda exhausted <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley">. Oh well I guess I’ll just try my best and get whatever I get because I can’t really improve my score now. I also haven’t even started studying for calc bc which is kind of concerning given that the exam’s in 3 days. Oh well. Also Mother’s Day is on Sunday and I need to make origami flowers in a makeshift vase which is a dressed up toilet paper roll, like I always do. But I’m kinda very low on time oops. And mother’s day was placed very inconveniently wrt ap exams lol<br>
I also haven’t been listening to much music recently because watching crash course videos and listening to music simultaneously is very hard <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
wrt greed control, maybe I’ll just give up on actually trying and pick the same number every day LMAO im getting lazy<br>
Oops I should really really go to sleep if I want to get up early tomorrow… rip<br>
If this was a depressing post dw dw I am perfectly fine just wanna skip to like MONDAY AFTERNOON yeah that would be nice.</div>

I am very very excited for June tho also because arml exists <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
I woke up at 3:50 am today and TRIED TO DO MATH FOR A FEW HOURS but my brain kinda died at 6am and I eventually ended up temporarily giving up on like 3 problems<br>
And then I was semi dead the whole morning maybe I shouldn’t wake up at 3:50<br>
Uhh greed control is harddd my nonexistent strategy kinda sucks <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
My phone somehow says that I average 16 hours of screentime a day-<br>
I’m basically gonna have to cram for ap exams nonstop this next week help<br>
I’m finally gonna have to face the repercussions of focusing on math the whole year and paying very little attention to schoolwork<br>
It’s so weird NOT having an important math comp coming up and I feel weirdly lazy, just doing geo isl problems when I feel like it<br>
But im still obsessed with oly geo! &lt;3<br>
Mathcounts nationals is coming up, dang the nostalgia… gl ppl!<br>
oh yeah also this is a fire song <iframe class="bbcode-youtube" style="width:425px;height:344px" type="text/html" width="425" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/chuo05LWTTg" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

			<div class="message">I GOT INTO SPARC!!!!!<br>
so I’m definitely going there instead of mathcamp<br>
Because first of all if I went to mathcamp I would literally be away from home beginning of June through mid August which is like wayyyy too long; my 8 yr old sister got pretty distressed when I was gone for egmo for only a week <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> and also I am somewhat of a mediator in my house so I can’t be gone too long,,,,<br>
Also sparc &gt;&gt; mathcamp according to my dad, and it’s 0 dollars vs 2000<br>
Am very excited for it!!!<br>
<br>
Also I’ve told some ppl about this already but Rachel Zhang (egmo team leader and MIT grad student) and some other ppl are founding a <b>residential summer math oly training camp for girls/nb</b> this year. A lot of other countries have EGMO training camps and the USA doesn’t have anything of this sort at all. However rather than being an EGMO training camp, this camp will just be a casual oly studying camp where you get to know other girls and socialize. There is no website yet since they only thought of this idea a few weeks ago, but they are in the process of making one.<br>
Since this is the first year it’s happening (tentatively the first two weeks of August) we’re only aiming for at least 10 ppl, however in the future about 30-40 ppl would be ideal. There will be an admissions process but it will be very small because of lack of time. <b>Let me know if you’re interested in this!!</b><br>
So ya thats where I will be for first half of August <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">what I do in school:<br>
history: is extremely boring so I struggle to pay attention and occasionally end up making origami corona stars and I end up getting nothing out of the class <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
chinese: is like the one interesting class. I actually pay attention because the teacher's really nice and we spend most of the time talking<br>
art: uh just art i guess<br>
english: kinda interesting but I'm HORRIBLE at english. I force myself to pay attention because the teacher's reallllly strict and would give me a bad grade if I didn't<br>
chemistry: just make origami corona stars the entire time lmao last class I made 4. the teacher is really chill and doesnt care also the material is really easy <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
math: I do absolutely no calculus work the entire time. I basically do hw from other classes, browse aops and discord, do daily challenge work (cuz i am kinda a staff member), and do other math. very useful study period <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
so as you may guess, I am absolutely ****** for the AP's <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
I haven't started studying for either of them (euro and calc bc)<br>
I'll probably study calc bc in the weekend between euro and calc bc<br>
and uhhh euro lets not even get into that<br>
I think I'll end up spending 90% of the next week watching crash course videos <img src="/assets/images/smilies/thumbup.gif" alt=":thumbup:" title=":thumbup:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
I don't care enough about school and thats baddd but next year I'll be forced to care more because classes will be 100000x harder <img src="/assets/images/smilies/thumbup.gif" alt=":thumbup:" title=":thumbup:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
uhh ive been doing a bit of math, which is actually 100% geo oops. geo is very fun! after doing some amount of geo isl problems i might switch to combo or nt... idk. I gotta at least do a decent amount of math or else I'll be rusty af when it comes time for mop. I have to admit I've been wasting a lot more time than when otis was still running <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

<br>
And again with a horrible score (21 this time, I mean that’s not a horrible score but for a mop qualifying score, it is)<br>
also rip partials<br>
<br>
I want to be really happy but also can’t help but feel a little bit sad, a feeling known by most pink moppers<br>
<br>
I don’t really know what to feel. Last year it was a burst of surprise and jumping up and down and screaming, because there was no way in the least that I expected the email. This year was the complete opposite in that the realization came ever so gradually- first I was 60% sure, then  70% sure, then 80%, 90%, 95%… and then yesterday I just couldn’t sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that I <i>actually made mop again</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And this year it’s in person. HOLY ******* ****, I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!! I really hope this next month passes like a heartbeat. And I also hope that I can preserve my diminishing math skill for the next month. I already feel like I’m declining, and that is my worst fear. I want to think that I’m too young to decline, but I’m not. It’s very common to decline when ur nearing the end of sophomore year of high school. I just want to hold onto my math skill for another year or two until I can finally let go of it and disappear into the vast unknown world of adulthood- but at the same time I don’t want to. Adulthood is going to be 100x worse and I’m gonna miss being a math olympian for every minute of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Will this summer be the peak of my life? Will 2022 be the peak of my life? It better not be, but I have a feeling it will at least be a local maximum. The fact that this summer will be so fun (well literally an insane level of fun) makes me fear that there will be something to balance it out. The problem with having your heart set on something, and looking forward to it 24/7, is that once it’s over you’re kinda down, like the low after a high. I hope I’ll be able to get used to normalcy again after so much excitement.<br>
<br>
<br>
But anyway, I’m really, REALLY happy, and relieved. Very relieved. It’s different when mop is literally in person and in the city you live in- you feel a blinding desire not to miss out. When the top 60 math olympians are hanging out in a building a mile away and ur just at home, there’s nothing to do but cry. I’m REALLY looking forward to meeting people after two years of just circular discord pfps. And not having as much impostor syndrome as last year- I think getting to know the otis community really helped. Congrats to everyone who made, and to everyone who didn’t, don’t give up. You all are amazing too. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"></div>

			<div class="message">I need to not stop doing math<br>
but otis year vii has basically ended and I need smth to occupy myself until summer hmm<br>
best options atm seem to be isl problems and my summer otis units which are unfortunately very hard<br>
I really need to not stop doing math; I think at some point everyone has to stop doing contest math, or at least cut down their time spent doing contest math by a lot, and that point often correlates roughly with the start of junior year since schoolwork gets really heavy, which is where I kinda am now; but I really don't want to give up contest math because I don't think I have much other stuff in life...<br>
<strike>did I make a mistake by choosing too heavy junior year classes</strike><br>
<br>
I have quite a lot of school work lol but at least I have long Easter weekend to make it up... and none of it is really hard it's just busy work<br>
I haven't really been doing much math because kinda lazy and also jetlagged; last night I slept 12 hours; but I have been doing random geo problems which always makes me happy<br>
darn I think im still very much in the vacation mode tho, and productivity is very hard<br>
<br>
low qual post cuz im kinda tired and so just wrote up some sht really quick<br>
<br>
I now have viva la vida stuck in my head,,,</div>

			<div class="message">Well in the morning we went on yet ANOTHER treasure hunt this time in budapest but this time there was a tour guide who told us a lot of answers<br>
And we were also very tired and lazy lmao<br>
We then had to do covid tests and awards ceremony and that was that<br>
They screwed up the top ~10 ppl tho, and put it in backwards order so I was last instead of jessica bruh lmao<br>
Then we had very fancy dinner (mc nats vibes) and afterwards there was a dance party<br>
We were doing like traditional hungarian dances or smth, but it was basically just a lot of running in circles and stuff, and me and 2 teammates absolutely killed our feet from running in dress shoes<br>
Then we played Chairman Mao with some other teams until like 1:30 am at which point we had to finish packing since we were leaving at 2:30 am<br>
I finished packing at 2:15 am and tried to fall asleep for 10 minutes which didn't really work but I did sleep 3 hours on the bus and plane today so far and 2 hours on trains yesterday so I'm pretty awake<br>
It has not quite hit me yet that egmo ended<br>
Apparently egmo 2023 is in a small city on the seaside in Slovenia :0</div>

			<div class="message">We basically spent the whole day on an excursion to some "hidden valley" I forgot the name of it oops<br>
It was a pretty far train ride from Eger<br>
And there was some sort of treasure hunt so we walk around the forest-like place and we get a math problem to solve, once we input the answer online AT a certain location it gives us the next math problem to solve and the nest location<br>
SO WE WERE EXPECTING LIKE AMC/AIME LEVEL MATH PROBLEMS, MAYBE MATHCOUNTS CDR LEVEL RIGHT??? AND THEY TURNED OUT TO BE AIME #15 LEVEL LMAO<br>
so we kinda got hard carried by jessica<br>
And kinda won<br>
But at the last part, we were supposed to solve 3 out of a set of 5 problems and the answer key was legit wrong which was kind of a scam but we still won (mostly thanks to jessica)<br>
We also saw a very aesthetic green lake, and 2 peacocks in someone's backyard<br>
Then we kinda got notified that scores were out while walking back to the train station and we basically started jumping up and down and yelling<br>
Lol Russia would've won had Putin not started a war tho<br>
PERU IS OP THO GO THEM<br>
After getting back to the hotel we went swimming and had dinner and then played some interesting quizzes which were much like Kahoot<br>
and then went to sleep, I actually went to sleep early and got 8 hrs of sleep bc we're literally pulling an all nighter tomorrow night, there's the closing party and we leave at 2:30 am</div>

			<div class="message">So uh this was contest day 2 I think<br>
My team basically begged our team leader and deputy leader to tell us our day 1 preliminary results cuz they had seen our day 1 papers already<br>
But they wouldnt tell us <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
At this point I thought I had solved all 3 on day 1 so I wasn't very stressed for day 2. I first tried the geo problem, died, solved #4, alternated between #5 and #6 for like 3 hours (but it turned out I misread #5, and it was much easier than what I thought it had been), then solved #5 and kinda bashed my head against #6 for the last hour<br>
Darn it was geo tho, and I couldn't do it<br>
Then uh we had lunch, we again begged the team leader and deputy leader and asked if anyone fakesolved problems and they were like UHHH SHOULD WE TELL THEM which was a bad sign because one of us def did fakesolve and eventually they were like "[v4913] fakesolved #2" LMFAOOO RIP<br>
I wasn't like extremely sad because I still had a decent?? chance at getting a gold medal from 4 solves + partials but idk thats still a rip<br>
Then we like played codenames with some ppl from the German team and then went to the archbishop's palace which was basically just a museum about catholicism, it did have a cool underground maze of tunnels which was supposed to be the wine cellar tho<br>
We also made egmo logos out of beads<br>
Then we basically had dinner, this whole time I was really scared for if I had fakesolved one of {4, 5} but since I had literally the same solutions as all my teammates it's pretty unlikely<br>
Then our deputy leader MADE us buy swimsuits cuz like we are going to the pool or smth, luckily swimsuits are REALLY cheap in Europe<br>
And then after successfully finding our way home in the dark (we had to lead the way or smth) we basically chilled and played cards and mafia and participated in a dance party to try and stay up until midnight, which was successful<br>
We DID almost fall asleep while "sleeping" in mafia tho<br>
And finally me and 2 teammates posted the problems on aops, we kinda posted them in c&amp;p by accident first lmfao<br>
And we finally went to bed at 00:30!!!<br>
Yeah we will probably be going to bed very late and getting very sleep deprived now that there is no competition and we can just screw around<br>
<br>
Idk why I'm awake I have to wake up at 7 aaaa</div>

			<div class="message">Wait yeah what even happened yesterday<br>
I think we woke up really late, and then had the opening ceremony and then lunch (and we may have played uno a lot in the middle)<br>
Then after lunch we got these booklets about the treasure hunt that was going to happen in the afternoon, basically we run around Eger (literally) searching for "treasure locations" some of which have EGMO organizers by them and some of which dont, and then we have to solve a puzzle based on what is at that location<br>
So we tried to solve parts of the puzzles beforehand without going to the actual locations; we weren't very successful<br>
There were so many treasure locations and we only got to like 60% of them (some of them were hard to find) running is hard<br>
Then we slowly went back to the hotel and ran into the SPAIN TEAM again along the way and they may or may not have been very obviously flirting with our deputy leader LMFAO they are like really talkative and flirty<br>
Anyway at dinner we were having a discussion with our team leader and deputy leader about like test taking rules and strategies (though our deputy leader was not really allowed to talk about problem related things with us since she had already seen the problems)<br>
And then we talked some more about like literally every rule and stuff until like 8:30 pm<br>
Jessica and Isabella wanted to last minute study after that (dedication omg) and I tried to also but failed as always, then I called my parents and went to bed, we all went to bed by 9:45<br>
<br>
Today I woke up at 7 so I got &gt;9 hours of sleep and didn't wake up the whole night LMAOOO it was great<br>
Not everyone in my team slept so well tho <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
"I didn't sleep well because I was like high on drugs" - Jessica (referring to melatonin)<br>
Then we all freaked out for another hour and had breakfast and stuff and then went into the contest room at 8:30 am... Kaylee was kinda jetlagged which was bad :/<br>
I have not really experienced any jetlag the whole trip tho somehow<br>
So we were all sitting at our desks with the huge folder of like problems and answer sheets and then suddenly, out of the blue, someone says "okay you may begin" LMAO RIP THAT WAS UNEXPECTED<br>
We weren't allowed to talk at all in the room <img src="/assets/images/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":|" title=":|" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
it was also kinda funny cuz Isabella brought a compass which apparently contained protractor tick marks on the inside that she had never realized existed LMAO and then the ppl took it away like 15 minutes into the contest after staring at it for a while (protractors are not allowed rip)<br>
I'm not allowed to discuss the problems yet but let's just say it went somewhat okay?? Which probably means I'm gonna fail day 2 lmfao<br>
Deputy leader said to forget whatever happened today and take the second day of the contest tomorrow like nothing ever happened which I will TRY to do<br>
We then had lunch, played cards with the Indian team (lmao our #1 source of entertainment is now playing cards) and then went to the Eger castle (which is more like a fort) for 2 hours it was very cool<br>
We went into this creepy underground thing that used to be a jail but looked more like a tomb and a museum<br>
Certain ppl on my team wanted to play pool, except the pool table is in a BAR so we didn't really want to go in cuz we're clearly underage<br>
So we found our team leader and deputy leader who were GRADING OUR PAPERS KDJFLJSJFJEKFJS and got them to come to the bar with us<br>
The bar ended up being really awkward cuz there were some grownups playing pool there and drinking at the same time<br>
Apparently we couldn't go then but we will probably try to play pool tomorrow<br>
I think after day 2 contest tomorrow, we're just gonna fool around for the last few days and do absolutely nothing useful <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley">)))<br>
<br>
I think I feel more like I fit in than I ever have since national mathcounts &lt;333<br>
<br>
LMFAO I HAVEN'T DONE HOMEWORK IN LIKE 4 DAYS LMAOOO IM JUST TOO LAZY AND DON'T CARE ENOUGH<br>
<br>
Some random things about Hungary (and Europe in general)<br>
<br>
The food is really good. Like they have actual food and not just fast food.<br>
The people are much more fit, I've seen like 1 obese person in the past few days.<br>
Everyone is much more respectful and mature (especially children). It's not considered as "cool" to break the rules than in America. People also seem less lazy.<br>
Other things are better too, like the windows, toilets, drinks, light switches, doors, etc.<br>
And everything is so close by and the public transport is ACTUALLY GOOD<br>
My team has come to a consensus that we don't want to go back to America lmao, gotta make egmo again next year ig :pain:<br>
<br>
Ok should probably go to sleep soon</div>

			<div class="message">Oops I should probably actually do some math sometime since competition day is tomorrow and I haven't done actual math since like, Sunday??<br>
We basically spent the morning chilling and playing tractor<br>
Then we packed up, left our luggage at the hotel and walked outside at noon... And walked around Budapest for a whole 3 hours lmfao<br>
It was very interesting tho, on one side of the river it is literally 100% castles and historical buildings that u can climb up and stuff, which we did<br>
And everything is so close by<br>
We then saw Béla Bollobás who is like a famous mathematician,,,,, it was <i>interesting</i><br>
He and his wife were very nice and funny, and they kept thinking we were the SINGAPORE team or smth??<br>
We finally met our deputy leader who has defended his PhD thesis yesterday or smth :0<br>
We were late for our bus to Eger (the city that the competition is in) so we took a train and arrived there at 8<br>
We saw our tour guide, who was very nice<br>
We were on a bus with a few other (European) teams for a short while but we didn't really talk to them oops<br>
It's really weird having all the other teams be able to speak a language that other ppl more or less won't understand and then we just be like<br>
When we got to the hotel we immediately saw the Indian team and Gunjan!!! Finally lmao<br>
We got a backpack filled with stuff and no one has any clue how they're going to carry it back.<br>
My roommate is Isabella!!!<br>
We are dinner with our tour guide and then when we were about to go back to the room we got stopped by the Spain team who are like REALLY, REALLY talkative LOL and our deputy leader just struck up a conversation with them which lasted like an hour and then we went downstairs at like 10pm to play card games for another 2 hours LOL and went to bed around 1 am rip<br>
Unfortunately no one on our team can really speak Spanish <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">(((<br>
Today is just the opening ceremony so we'll have a tonnnn of time <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
Edit: im lazy so might combine the next 2 days into 1 post</div>

			<div class="message">After getting to the hotel in Budapest, we decided to walk around outside without a map and there was a very huge river nearby with a ton of bridges so we decided to cross it, then we saw a ton of ppl walking up a path to some statue so we followed them<br>
It was a very long path but eventually we got to the top, and there were a few huge statues surrounded with barbed wire so you couldn't get anywhere close<br>
A lot of things have barbed wire here or random spikes at the top maybe to prevent thieves?<br>
There are also pigeons everywhere<br>
We also went into what looked like a church but was actually a huge market with lots of small stalls, didn't buy anything tho<br>
After dinner we basically played uno and this card game called tractor for like 2 hrs lmao, Isabella and I got brutally slaughtered at tractor....<br>
Then I slept 10-5<br>
Hopefully we will meet other teams today!!!</div>

			<div class="message">I spent yesterday morning and the night before that trying to convince my parents to let me not bring a suitcase<br>
Finally succeeded, fortunately <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
First flight to DC was pretty uneventful<br>
Then I saw Kaylee (teammate) and Rachel (team leader) and we chilled and ate expensive airport food <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> and talked about random stuff<br>
We went to airport lounge and played cards and I realized how bad at cards I am<br>
And we also tried to make an egmo playlist<br>
We met up with Jessica (teammate) and Isabella (teammate) around 4 and played uno for a long time<br>
All the parents were talking in Chinese and I can't understand Chinese<br>
Parents don't usually come but they had to this time bc of quarantine stuff<br>
Then we boarded the plane to Munich and I tried to do some math (an Insect Land problem) because *certain teammates* were being productive <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> but failed and got basically nowhere<br>
Then we ate airplane food which was tasty as always and played a ton of uno (which was very fun) until like 7:30 et when we realized we should try to sleep because in 6 hrs it would be morning in Munich<br>
But like how do u sleep at 7:30<br>
We failed at sleeping for the next like 5 hrs, then ate some more food and basically were plane sick for the last hour<br>
Kinda sleep deprived and being very unproductive <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
Oh yeah and ISABELLA wrote a very aesthetic sol to egmo 2018 #1 with an aesthetic pen on some random display notebook in a random store in Munich and a lot more aesthetic stuff <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
Now we are in Munich awaiting flight to Budapest<br>
<br>
Oh and I also got my apmo score back... And that was kind of :cold_face:</div>

			<div class="message">but now I'm scared af because I realized that<br>
I'm kind of borderline for mop<br>
And I HAVE TO make mop. The pink cutoff is so low if I can't make it then I'm actually the definition of an idiot. I think I have an 85% chance of making it given that I'm 98% sure I'm going to get 7's on all the problems I solved because I really didn't handwave anything<br>
But the other 15% in which I don't make it is <i>pure unimaginable</i>. In that other 15% I probably actually will get depression and cry for the entire summer. And maybe quit math for an amount of time because of too much depression. (I've seen this happen to wayyy too many people and it would be literal hell if I'm next in line.) And I might start doing math again eventually but it wouldn't be the same and I would have only 15% of the motivation I had before and I would be 99% sure I peaked in 2021. I don't want to think at all about that other 15%; thats basically my life going to trash and everything crumbling in front of me.<br>
<br>
On another note I have literally so much respect for like red green (blue black) moppers (and actually anyone who got like 4 solves on jmo/2 solves on amo) yall are beyond geniuses. Getting to that level is insane and I can't even imagine the work ethic you'd need to reach it. Probably like my worth ethic x3 at least. Wtf how are people so dedicated.<br>
<br>
Everyone who got 28+- on jmo DEFINITELY deserves mop. (And I'm praying that u will make)<br>
<br>
On another note, although above described moppers are insanely op, they gotta be doing not much other than math/stem. Unless they're like super humans which some of them are. But I also have HUGE respect for ppl who are actually stepping back and looking at the big picture - beyond math contests and getting into college. In 10 years yall will be the real front of the pack. My dad says mop is actually <i>not</i> the best community, because everyone is so focused on grinding math they have basically dedicated their lives to that and it's not so good for their brains, and that in general the math community is so competitive there's relatively little notion of support/compassion. Which I kind of agree with, even though it's fun to get to the top in high school, if you don't really know where you're headed later then you're kind of screwed<br>
<br>
like me-<br>
<br>
o and also I should be very very grateful for getting j3 or else I'd probably be crying right now<br>
<br>
Back to attempting ioi why am I so bad<br>
<br>
tldr; everyone is op but especially ppl who are NOT tunnel minded into math comps</div>

Torture. So much of this jmo was torture. I spent 5 hours total on problems 2 and 5 combined, and ended up <b>not solving either of them</b>. There's a horrible feeling seeing the time counting down and knowing you won't be able to solve it. One of the worst feelings ever. I don't know how people can solve stuff in the last 20 minutes. My brain just goes into ultimate panic mode.<br>
<br>
I'm actually so disappointed in myself. I've done oly VERY seriously for the past year, like I literally dedicated all my time to it. And all that comes out? The exact same score as last year on JMO. <span class="bbfont-half">and egmo qualification but that's irrelevant.</span> I want to blame it on the subject distrib but the subject distrib is luck. Literally everything is based on luck. Really, I'm just bad.<br>
<br>
I don't think I would have done any better if I had done mock jmo's beforehand. <b>I really just need to get better at non geo subjects, in particular algebra and nt.</b> Like really. I think I failed myself in a billion different ways on this jmo. I promised 9th-grade me I would get at least 4 problems the next time… but no. I thought I was decent at combo but haha nope. And I got f'ed by the p5 nt again. FOR THE SECOND TIME. I don't even want to think about how close I was. Or how simple the problem was. But that's just so dang depressing. Literally, the second I saw that the geo was p4 and p5, I thought, this is gonna be tough. The geo was trivial so I had 4 entire hours to work on p5 and guess what, I still couldn't solve it. It's only a JMO P5. But I couldn't solve it.<br>
<br>
Why did maa have to give me a day of fake bliss, like couldn't they have just broken the reality right away?<br>
<br>
Do I have any hope for oly geo, like REAL GEO, ever showing up on contest again? There was not a slightest hint of classic circles and triangles geo on this year's usamo or jmo. In that sense, I'm kinda glad I'm graduating soon. In a few years euclidean geo will literally be gone.<br>
But I swear, the only reason why I got 3 problems last year was because there was a p2 euclidean geo and that saved me. This year my 3rd solve wasn't a euclidean geo; I swear to God I have improved since a year ago, but I still have yet to prove myself.<br>
<br>
I'm actually not sad about the subject distrib (for jmo). It was good for non geo mains, and I know a lot of non geo mains who really needed this. I think overall, geo being p4 benefited more people than if geo was being p5. So I'm glad God made it this way. I'm praying for those people.<br>
<br>
I wrote this at 3am because I was high and semi depressed<br>

			<div class="message">for the next few months/year<br>
<br>
I did like no math yesterday because 1) I usually do barely any math the day after submitting an otis unit and 2) I had an all day confirmation retreat (I'm getting Confirmed the day after ARML 2022) and had to teach classes when I got home<br>
I'm trudging through dcy-ioi <strike>why are all the problems like hit-or-miss</strike> I want to finish this unit before jmo (which means before the 22nd, since I'll probably be on discord that whole morning smh my head and I also have to re-learn bary bash that day) so this will be like, nearly impossible<br>
<br>
well ive made up my mind, im not gonna practice any mock jmo's<br>
sounds like a horrible idea but if I do I'll either 1) become depressed and do horribly or 2) become confident that I'll do well and thus also do horribly; it happens every time so I think this is better for my mental helth<br>
and also I won't be able to focus properly at home<br>
so I guess I'll just go into it kind of blindly, I mean I took apmo less than a week ago so I kind of am used to oly environment<br>
<br>
how is spring break <i>only</i> half over?? usually it sweeps by but this past week has felt like a year,, and these next 2 days will probably feel like 2 years because there is this huge glass wall in the middle of time called JMO and I have to pass it to see anything ahead<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">dreams</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">yesterday: i was at the cafeteria at my school's DANCE??? i never go to dances and one of my kind-of friends was telling me about how she was doing WOOT (no one in my school cares about math like literally no one) and liked FE's like bruh FE's.<br>
<br>
today: 1. We were at school but it was really weird cuz the teachers were only teaching oly math and all the non-fit ppl suddenly did a lot of sports and were really fit. I found out that one of my kind-of friends actually goes to two different schools at once and is like way smarter than I thought. I was spinning around a bag of apples for whatever reason I don't remember. Then we had to do some sort of a "puzzle" which was really just finding the names of the elements in the periodic table in LATIN, and it was easy cuz my brother and I had like 118 metal water bottles labeled (tho some were incorrect) with the latin names of the elements that we brought to school every day...<br>
2. My family and I was supposed to go on a plane and when we were paying for the plane tickets the guy had to give us each back 25 dollars but my sister wouldn't accept the money for whatever reason?? When we finally got on the plane I somehow "didn't deserve" to sit down so I like kind of sat down but not really; I think we all were having self confidence issues or something. And I kept dropping my phone too. Also john0512 and mathicorn were on our plane, and... john0512 kept kissing mathicorn's EYES. (Also they were both wearing masks and mathicorn was not wearing glasses) pls help<br>
<br>
still havent dreamed abt the jmo</div></div>

and then I had to hang her body, which was just clothes because somehow the actual person part of her had disappeared, onto hangers in my mom's closet<br>
also we were late for school because it was 8:02 and we were still at home<br>
yesterday: I was taking some practice ap exams at school over spring break but I signed up for the chem and english exam at the same time?? so i could only go to one?? (ftr I'm not taking ap chem OR ap english this year) so I chose chem over english but I didnt realize I needed paper and pencil and calculator or smth so I was really late and then I just barely got there in time, it was like this huge room with a conveyor belt that u walk on to get registered so yeah and then when the exam actually started, it was literally not even ap exam it was MATHCOUNTS COUNTDOWN style basically they just put the question on the screen and everyone discusses and it was MATH NOT SCIENCE like what the heck. i was happy tho<br>
a few days ago: uh caroline and eyed were dating thats about it I forget the rest.</div><br>

I have stopped playing pimantle/semantle because no time and also things get kinda boring after a while.<br>
<br>
I wasted way too much time yesterday. I wasted 2 hours trying to find OTIS diamonds and didn't find any. I'm kinda trudging through OTIS units (I think I finally half get the hang of snake oil now but it took like an entire day.) I could be going faster/doing more math but idk I just don't feel like it. Way too many units to do eeeeeee<br>
<br>
Oh ya daylight savings was last weekend and I've been waking up so late (also because it's spring break). Like 6:45/7 ish. Which is really bad because I get like 30% of my math done before other ppl have woken up <strike>which may correlate with the fact that I am able to listen to music during that time.</strike> Need to wake up earlier eeeeee<br>
<br>
JMO cutoff stuff is interesting... as evan called it, "a soap opera". Am getting slightly nervous so I have resorted to counting down the hours (probably NOT the best idea). And no, I have not mocked JMO yet... am kinda too scared to ngl LMAO<br>
<br>
Not excited for the polygon geo and nontraditional ineqs that will probably be on the JMO</div>

:weary: I was in 8th grade having the time of my life with mc states right around the corner!! and then mathcounts cancels like THE DAY BEFORE and I'm devastated but also I can see a door opening into a new episode of my life called quarantine so thats kind of interesting despite being extremely chaotic, worst friday the 13th ever<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">rant abt ineqs</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">im getting slaughtered by EZ INEQS ,,,so im doing baw-ineqbasic and ive muirhead-bashed literally all the symmetric ineqs we love muirhead &lt;3<br>
as for the non-symmetric ones, well im basically dying on those &lt;/3<br>
except square roots. square roots are rly sad cuz u cant muirhead bash them T_T and I always end up trying to use cauchy and then muirhead but cauchy is so weaK?!?! it never seems to be strong enough<br>
i can still barely understand tangent line trick (well I actually can't understand it I only pretend to)<br>
<br>
im only doing ineqs bc I feel like doing b alg units and fe's or anything of the sort are still too scary</div><br>

ig im kinda lucky my parents dont care too much abt my grades (and theyre like 'u only have to do math') but I can tell they're getting a little concerned cuz this is prob the first time ive ever gotten a sub A- in any class and 10th grade isnt even supposed to be hard esp not with my classes</div><br>

I should not be paying this much attention to levels tho<br>
like how I used arch too much before<br>
levels mean like nothing and u can get high in them by like submitting way too many hours, looking up problem sols etc they are in no way a measure of capability//<br>
but at least they were motivation<br>
I don't know what I'm going to do after otis yr vii<br>
there's like &lt;1 month left and I still have a bunch of things to do (B genfunc, D ioi, some random nt units, and mmp?? (probably not)) and I should actually be doing past egmo problems and <b>MOCKING JMO'S</b> neither of which I am doing-<br>
help why is there so little time<br>
<br>
I dont even know if im gonna do otis next yr<br>
like this yr ive done most of the units that are my level (D ish) so idk what I would do next yr<br>
i mean ig I could attempt the super hard units but I need to somehw become not scared of those first<br>
actualy now that I think abt it I probably will do otis next yr I'll just end up doing subjects im not so good at tho, like nt (and will need to find a different source of geo problems)</div><br>

I dont even feel like mocking jmo at all rn this is not very good<br>
I feel like I'll do better without mocking than mocking<br>
last yr I like basically didnt mock at all and expected like 14 max and somehow overperformed<br>
so maybe if I dont mock I will overperform again////////////?<br>
I just dont want to face the reality that I'm actually <i>not</i> that good at jmo which will probably show through if I mock<br>
also I literally cant focus correctly in mocks; it has to be the real thing//<br>
well I prob will do at least like 1 mock just as a reminder of what jmo problems are like<br>
<br>
tldr; I should mock but I really dont want to</div></div>

<br>
I'm posting here because many people visit (since v is orz) and I need some advice.<br>
<br>
So a 7th grader came up to me asking how to be good at math, as they heard that I'm the best at my school. Let's call them "N". They also asked for my autograph xD. Today, N came up to me and said that they want to be like me when and asked for help. I didn't know what to say, so I just said "idk". I kinda felt bad. Any advice to what to tell them?</div>

			<div class="message">I honestly dont know who my greatest math role models were growing up. I cant think of anyone off the top of my head, other than like jessica wan who is in my grade and I guess I idolized her but she wasnt exactly a role model.<br>
<br>
That is, other than a certain <b>alifenix-</b>.<br>
<br>
If you've never read a certain blog <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c485220" class="bbcode_url" target="_blank">silly bird</a> you're missing out on something- it's the single most inspirational thing that has helped me in my life. On the same level as like, EGMO. First of all I'm always in awe at ppl who rise <i>fast</i>. Like, I'm one of those boring kids who started math at an early age. Whenever you hear about legends like this it's ultra-special.<br>
<br>
Ali probably doesn't remember this, but I saw her in person. In MOP 2019. I didn't make MOP in 2019. I was basically dragged by my parents to MOP every year as far back as I can remember, maybe 2012 or something. It was the ultimate form of torture and one of the things I am most embarrassed about to this day- I had to witness people who were the utmost form of great while I was a mere sub-mortal. Not because it was damaging to my ego, but because it seemed too heavenly for my unexperienced self. I was a weak sprout, getting a taste of the strongest most brilliant sunshine there is out there. Somehow my parents thought it was a good idea. I was really scared of MOPpers for the longest time. Like at MPfG, I refused to sit within like 3 feet of a MOPper. Maybe this was because of the enormous pressure to be one- I can never look my target in the eye. Like I cannot think about college these days because I can't know my goal too well; I have to aim blindly.<br>
<br>
At least I turned out to be something. Kind of. If I hadn't, who knows what would have become of me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on some day in June 2019 I saw Ali walking along a path at CMU with a huge backpack and holding a paper plate with a slice of pizza. It was almost-dark and she had a whimsical expression (as she always does) and maybe earbuds. I was probably with my mom and maybe my siblings.<br>
<br>
We walked right by each other because we were going different directions; she didn't pay us any attention because her mind was clearly someplace else. Her backpack was basically the size of her, and she was basically my mom's height which makes me all the more interested (as a short person, I find it inspiring when short people are successful.)<br>
<br>
I remember this image as clear as if it was yesterday.<br>
<br>
I saw Ali many more times but that time just stands out. (In particular, she was often in the piano room playing music with <b>The_Turtle</b> but let's not talk about all the things I witnessed during those devastating days. I just wanted to be invisible.) Anyway, you probably have no idea how inspiring it is to see your #1 role model up close, because 7th-grade-me was completely blown away. For a solid couple years Ali was the most beautiful human I had ever seen. No joke. I wasn't attracted to her; I'm straight; I just thought her mental and physical characteristics matched up nearly perfectly with my ideals. Which I still stand by to this day. She also has some<br>
insanely impressive writing skills which I may or may not have tried to replicate in this post (#yearlyidolizationattempt) but always fail. I think something about her is superhuman.<br>
<br>
Attached are the first thing I ever said to Ali and something she said soon after.<br>
<br>
The second thing is probably one of the biggest blows my weak, soft middle schooler brain has ever taken. I was probably on the verge of tears when I saw that. I thought to myself, "it's not my fricking fault that's how it is. I wish it wasn't this way either. I really do." but of course I didn't say that. I wasn't even mad at Ali. I don't think it's possible to get mad at god. I was merely being reminded of the obvious- how I didn't belong in my position, and I needed a blow on the head to wake up and realize what wonderful sunshine I was getting when all the other young sprouts were in the dark.<br>
<br>
Of course I've recovered from that. It's was just nature giving me that occasional mandatory push; <i>you need to try harder</i>. And I find it amazing that I can now connect with Ali and have normal discussions with her. She is an amazing and wonderful friend. &lt;3 Although she probably doesn't know it, and neither do my parents, Ali has done way more in my life than anyone else, except maybe my parents.<br>
<br>
If you asked me about someone who really inspired me to do math, I would have one-- and exactly one-- answer.<br>

I have this problem where I always feel unproductive though unless I do A LOT of math<br>

			<div class="message">kinda low quality but its been 4 days-<br>
so rip the ukraine russia thing I should probably be paying more attention to whats happening but if there is actually a ww3....<br>
tbh it is kinda lucky that the US has survived the past like, 50 yrs without any major conflicts though (I may be wrong cuz I'm not a history expert) and I am very lucky to have had nothing remotely bad happen in my life so far other than a pandemic<br>
so ig we are due for a conflict???<br>
well I'm kinda having the time of my life right now, am working (pretty slowly) on g summit, I haven't actually done a geo unit since like early september and dang it is satisfying not having to use hints for almost everything and actually finally doing geo and geo is very fun so yeha probably best few days in a while in terms of personal satisfaction<br>
also doing rly badly in greed control im not rly even trying, just putting the same number every day...<br>
ive also done like 0 homework this week very fun<br>
tho I have a test tmr and a speech to prep for<br>
dang how is the 2nd trimester already over</div>

			<div class="message">aight that was a huge fail<br>
So first I did mediocre-bad on alg/nt with a 4/10, wasn't really expecting anything since I'm really bad at alg/nt<br>
Then proceeded to absolutely throw geo with a 5/10 basically I was panicking really hard the whole time because I thought it was the only topic for which I had a chance at anything. So I only had time to solve the first 6 problems but then realized in the last 30 seconds I had done the answer extraction wrong for #6 and put in the right answer but time had just ran out. So that was sad rip<br>
But if u thought that wasn't a fail well I actually failed on combo with a literal 2/10. Idek what happened there but my brain was kinda ded.<br>
For the team rounds I basically only contributed 1 problem on the team round, problem 5, because I spent a whole 1/2 hour on it idk how. And I had to leave around the beginning of guts to teach a class so rip.<br>
Anyway I think I significantly deproved from last year (in which I got 4/5/4??) But oh well ig I can't have everything.</div>

			<div class="message">so i FiNaLLy finished D equality which took so very long because whenever I get distracted by something like aime for a few days it's really hard to switch into oly mode again ahhhhh<br>
<br>
well this huge incident has been going on at school for the past like 2-3 weeks, basically some popular kids in my grade made a racist video (as a joke) and got expelled<br>
its kinda a big deal when 3 kids in ur grade get expelled when there are only 60 ppl in ur grade total...<br>
anyway its really controversial because like 1/2 the school (in particular the black student union) is extremely mad at those kids and has been forcing the administration to take action quickly while the other 1/2 thinks its nothing bc they just made one mistake and it shouldnt affect them for the rest of their lives<br>
so we barely got anything done in school the past almost 3 weeks because we've been having discussions like every day abt racism and a lot of ppl in the school are very heavily affected by the incident<br>
<br>
rip I have a 10 page story due tonight which I think I did a pretty bad job on because I procrastinated way too much and I can barely even read it because its so cringy so idk how im gonna finish it<br>
anyways<br>
need to do some testsolving<br>
<br>
im most definitely not doing as much math as I should be rn....</div>

			<div class="message">in 40 minutes, IRL arml practice will start again.<br>
for the first time since march 7, 2020.<br>
<br>
irl arml practice was my fricking LIFE in 8th grade.<br>
literally all my friends were there and we just clowned around the whole time, even though we didn't do much math.<br>
it was by far the best 2 hours of every week, because it was the only time when I could hang out with my math friends<br>
which by the way I had quite a lot of math friends,, I had so much clout in 8th grade!!<br>
<br>
now guess what<br>
<br>
only like 1 of my then-friends is going to arml today ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE BASICALLY STOPPED DOING MATH. what the **** has covid done?????? well no this is not just covid ig its just natural demotivation<br>
but still HOLY ****, SO MUCH HAS CHANGED IN 2 YEARS<br>
EVEN MY BROTHER SAYS SO<br>
<br>
I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HECK THIS WILL BE LIKE BUT STILL EXCITED AF!!!!<br>
definitely not used to going to arml as a fricking boomer and old and jaded 10th grader<br>
<br>
will update later with what happened lmao<br>
<br>
Edit: ok so that was a bit underwhelming<br>
but it was still fun(ny)<br>
so first of all literally none of my friends except 1 was there, we had fun though<br>
the teacher was this rly chinese dude who<br>
1) expects me to instasolve aime problems<br>
2) said that my brother got a trash amc score and could have gotten &gt;=120 if he had neater scratchwork (ftr I have like the most illegible scratchwork ever)<br>
3) said that usamo problem 4's should be easy<br>
4) cold called on ppl randomly<br>
5) roasted someone for not writing Proof: before their proof on the blackboard (ftr it was a rly casual proof and why would you need to write that)<br>
LOLOL we had too much fun tho oops. and ngl I actually learned smth, the topic was (oly ?) nt and I learned how to prove wilsons theorem ikr I'm so bad.<br>
o but it was rly shocking... there were literally 7 ppl in varsity and ~20 ppl in JV (most of whom are immature 8th graders) and literally the best person other than me was an 8th grader who used to be rly immature (threw pizza in the trash and stuff) but is actually kinda pro now.<br>
dang stuff changes<br>
<br>
<span class="bbfont-three-q">also excuse the non explicit curses I only put them for emphasis from lack of stronger words</span></div>

<br>
Time skip<br>
<br>
Isn’t it crazy how one’s whole future, for the next few months, can be decided by just one test? How one tiny span of 3 hours carries so much weight?<br>
<br>
I open the booklet and first skim the questions; what immediately jumps out at me is that there’s a lot of geo. Particularly in the last half, which was looking absolutely amazing. Maybe this will will actually be a good aime after all.<br>
<br>
I spend an awful long time on problem 1, getting an answer of <b>640</b>. Idk, I’m just not quite in the right mental state yet.<br>
<br>
Problem 2 is pretty easy; I get <b>227</b>, and so is problem 3 (problem 3 is really nice by the way, it’s just the average of 333+333-500) and 500, and so I get <b>242</b>.) I’m beginning to wonder if this aime is easier than normal, but I’m not sure yet.<br>
<br>
Problems 4 is okay too, even though I’m horrible at complex numbers - I somehow do it with DeMoivre’s formula and get <b>834</b>.<br>
<br>
Then I look at Problem 5. An entire paragraph, and even worse, it contains <i>rates</i>. The very first thing I notice is 264 - <i>lol, imagine if the answer is 69</i>. At first I have no clue what to do; I don’t think I’ve ever seen a problem involving something going diagonally against the current. I first try to think about “how much the people are affected by the current”, and come up with some sort of idea: 80 - 10 = 60 + 10. <i>But what does the 10 mean?</i> The main problem I don’t know how to solve is dealing with the current pushing in a weird direction with respect to the peoples’ paths.<br>
<br>
I eventually draw a simple and useful looking diagram, after thinking about what happens if we pretend the current doesn’t exist. Then the people <i>think</i> they’re traveling to some spot on the north bank somewhere to the left of the actual spot they end up at, and we get a nice looking triangle with lengths in a 3:4 ratio, and we can find the distance between where they aim for and where they actually end with d=vt. Miracle #1.<br>
<br>
The problem is trivial with pythag after this, and I’m relieved. I get an answer of <b>550</b>.<br>
Problems 6 and 7 don’t look hard, they’re just a matter of casework and estimation respectively, and I get <b>228</b> and <b>289</b>.<br>
<br>
It’s been almost an hour; I’m going at a comparable pace to the mock aime’s I did a few days ago. I look at problem 8, which is geometry. The first thing I notice is… <i>mixtillinear incircle?!? what the heck??</i> but then I realize the triangle is equilateral, so knowing stuff about mixtillinear incircles really doesn’t help much after all. However, when I finish drawing the diagram, I realize my meager knowledge of mixtillinear incircles may actually be useful - I find that the tangency points are simply the trisection points of the sides of the big triangle, and that you can get a much simpler diagram by deleting the original triangle and replacing it with the triangle formed by the midpoints of arcs. (Miracle #2, I guess??) Now it’s just a matter of pythag, and I get an answer of <b>378</b>. Beautiful problem.<br>
<br>
I move on to problem 9, which I’m quite sure I fakesolved because my method seems way too simple to be true - just give each of the even numbered blanks a different color and same for the odd numbered blanks - but I put down <b>247</b>, and move on.<br>
It’s been an hour and I’ve done 9 problems. Ahead of schedule, actually. I’m beginning to think this aime is quite a bit easier than normal… or maybe it’s just the fact that I’m in a very quiet room with almost zero distractions as opposed to my loud house or at 5 AM when it’s kinda hard to focus.<br>

Another geo!! Problem 10 looks very interesting, actually. If only I can grasp exactly what to do with these congruent circles. After drawing some hopeless diagrams of the spheres themselves, I end up drawing just the three congruent circles as if it was in 2d, and then drawing small segments connecting the circles’ centers to the spheres’ centers, which I label h_1, h_2, and h_3. Then I create some equations using the 11, 13, 19 lengths and am able to solve for h_1, h_2, and h_3. They are all nice numbers, which is a good sign. I’m a bit stuck when it comes to finding the answer, but then I realize it’s just trivial by pythag, and get an answer of <b>756</b>. Nice.<br>
<br>
Then I try Problem 11, which is also geo, and looks pretty tame. It in fact reminds me of a particular NICE problem. I instinctively try Power of a Point first, and then label some lengths in terms of x. I spend a few minutes thinking about how to involve the tangents of length 20 and 6 to find the value of x, even trying the half angle formula at some point, but eventually I see a pair of similar triangles (formed by the vertical diameter of the circle and the diagonal transversal) and solve for x pretty quickly, getting an answer of <b>150</b>. I think that problem is a bit too easy for a problem 11, but it may be just me.<br>
<br>
I’m about 1 hour 20 minutes in, and 10 problems solved, which is definitely faster than my pace usually is. I glance at Problem 12 and Problem 13, which I’m too lazy to read carefully at first, and then notice that Problem 14 is geo (my booklet was really weird and 1-7, 8-10, 11-13, 14-15 were all on different pages). I think I have time to jump around now, so I draw the diagram and instantly notice something about semiperimeter - but no, that was not exactly it. I realize that if X and Y are the intersection points of the two dividing lines with BC (I assume that BC&gt;AB, AC) then BX and CY can be computed in terms of AB and AC. Then I notice that MB + BX = NC + CY = 219/2 (I hope I’m not getting M and N mixed up), and so it only looks reasonable to extend AB and AC to M’ and N’ such that MM’ = NN’ = 219/2. Then I stare at the diagram for a few minutes, and realize that <b>N, X, M’ and M, X, N’ look collinear</b>. Like <i>very</i> collinear. WHAT?! I quickly try to prove it, realizing that MM’ = MN = NN’ = 219/2, and so the claim is obviously true. This means that MNX + NMY = 30, and by angle chasing angle A = 120. WHOA. Miracle #3.<br>
<br>
The obvious thing to do next is Law of Cosines, from which I get something like AB^2 + AC^2 + AB*AC = 219^2, and we want to find integer solutions.<br>
<br>
<i><b>DID THE PROBLEM JUST TURN FROM GEO INTO NT?!?!</b></i><br>
<br>
This is unfortunately not factorable, and 219^2 is unfortunately very large, so I try taking mod 3, and find that AB and AC must be the same remainder mod 3. Not very helpful. I try the case where they are both 0 mod 3, which is somewhat nicer to deal with since the numbers are smaller, but still really annoying, and there are also the cases where they are 1 or 2 mod 3. <i>How do I know which one to examine?</i> Something tells me I must give up because this is taking too much time - I only have a little more than an hour left - but I keep going, because <i>the answer extraction shouldn’t be too hard, right?? This is literally the <b>answer extraction</b>. I already did most of the problem, right???</i><br>
<br>
More time passes, and I realize I’m being really unproductive. This is why I do so badly on aime’s - because I <i>burn out</i>. I must <b>not</b> burn out now.<br>
<br>
I officially hate the number 219.<br>
<br>
At some point I try something really stupid - trying to find a substitute for the Law of Cosines by using pythag (which are literally the same thing anyways) - and fail in drawing a 30-60-90 triangle so that the 60 degree angle looks like 90, and I somehow get the false equation AC^2 + (AB + AC/2)^2 = 73^2. I actually find a pythagorean triple that works here - 48, 55, 73 - and start to get really excited inside. But then I test it with Law of Cosines and it doesn’t work - <i>what the heck did I do?! This has to be right!!</i> Eventually I realize that I made literally the stupidest mistake ever, <i>wow</i>.<br>
<br>
There is one hour left, and I’m left with two choices: Either keep going with this problem and possibly find the answer and finally, for once, have solved a problem 14 correctly, or move onto a different problem, maybe problem 12 or 13, which I may have a greater chance at solving. I end up abandoning problem 14, although it makes me really sad to - I <i>really do</i> think that I have gotten the bulk of the problem already, and it feels too close to let go of.<br>
<br>
However, I attempt problem 13 (since problem 12 looked scary with all the notation) and I have definitely seen this type of problem before. I just don’t <i>quite</i> know where to start. After not too long I realize that there are only a few different types of numbers to count: numbers relatively prime to 3, 11, and 101, numbers divisible by 3 but relatively prime to 11 and 101 AND &lt;=1111, numbers divisible by 11 but relatively prime to 3 and 101 AND &lt;=909, and numbers divisible by 3 and 11 but relatively prime to 101 AND &lt;=101. From here it’s pretty easy to calculate the total number of ways (since I’m bad at counting, I use venn diagrams), and I get an answer of <b>392</b>.<br>
<br>
There’s about half an hour left, so I decide to quickly attempt problem 12. I know I should definitely be checking problems though, but somehow I feel more confident about my answers than I usually do. For most of the problems, I actually had better solutions than just casework bashing (which is very easy to make mistakes with.) Problem 12 seems really hard, especially because I don’t know any identities involving the squares of binomial coefficients. (Well actually I did see one on the bax-sums otis unit, but of course I wouldn’t have memorized it.) I find a formula for the sum for any value of n, but it’s an ugly summation that I don’t know how to evaluate. I bash out a few terms for small values of n, but there’s no obvious pattern and I know I should better give up now.<br>
<br>
There are 20 minutes left, and I have 12 problems to check. I glance at problem 1, and I’m too lazy to do algebra right now, so I skip it for now, especially since problem 2 is much easier to check. The next few problems are pretty easy to check, and I don’t find any mistakes with them, but I realize I’m running out of time.<br>
<br>
“You have 15 minutes left”.<br>
<br>
Only 15 minutes left, and I still have to check over half of the problems I did.<br>
<br>
I start thinking out loud; no one can hear me anyways, not with a mask and the loud air purifier. I start going through problems faster and faster, but it’s not fast enough. Time rushes down the drain like water.<br>
<br>
I hurry to check problem 11 - there are only 5 minutes left, and I <b><i>still have not bubbled in any of my answers</i></b>. Fortunately (or unfortunately), I have not found any mistakes with any of my answers so far. <i>Could this really be true?</i> After all, I don’t even have time to fix a mistake if I find one. <i>That’s the problem with waiting until the very end to check my answers, smh.</i><br>
<br>
I skip checking problem 13 since I did it and read through all of it so recently, and so it’s still much too fresh in my mind.<br>
<br>
Then I read through the line of check marks on my paper. There’s something missing. I have not checked problem 1 yet.<br>
<br>
I almost get a heart attack when I notice that at the top of the paper, I have written 2pq+2rs instead of 2pq-2rs. I had initially mistaken the -2 for a 2, and had forgotten to change it in the final expression. Wow.<br>
<br>
At least this mistake is easy to fix - I already have pq = 349 and rs = 291, so it’s just a matter of plugging things in. But my heart is beating so fast, and I can barely think. <i>is 58*2 = 116?</i> I don’t even have time to check it. I scribble down <b>116</b>, and start scribbling down numbers on the answer sheet. I still have to bubble in the bubbles.<br>
<br>
I glance at the analog clock: 2 minutes. I don’t even know for sure, because it’s a literal ANALOG clock. <i>Two? One? Three?</i> I don’t even want to think about it.<br>
<br>
I think about yelling “how much time left?”, but that would distract me too much, and for the proctor to answer would already take too many seconds.<br>
<br>
I’m now onto the bubbles. I start at problem 1 since it’s the closest, then go to problem 9 and then problem 2, etc, so that I have to move my hand as little as possible. I am trembling and there is probably only 1 minute left, or less. F*** my life.<br>
<br>
The bubbles are so messy that some have lines straying out of the circle. I try my best to make the part inside dark.<br>
<br>
I hear a movement from my proctor’s table; she is picking up her phone. <i>Oh no… she wouldn’t pick up her phone unless she was literally about to call time.</i> I still have about 1/2 or 1/3 of my answers left to bubble.<br>
<br>
I go faster, trying to stay calm so that I can actually fill in the bubbles. I somehow get almost to the right side of the paper - I’m on like Problem 6 or something.<br>
<br>
A part of me is surprised that time hasn’t been called yet, and I even start thinking about the worst case scenario - <i>what if I don’t have time to bubble everything in? Can I get away with bubbling them in afterwards, since I already have the numerical answers written across the top?</i> But no, I couldn’t risk it. I should stop thinking those thoughts.<br>
<br>
Last problem: Problem 8, on the rightmost side. I only have to get through this, then I will be free.<br>
<br>
I can almost hear time being called in my head. First bubble, second bubble…<br>
<br>
Third bubble. It’s so messy that I can see slivers of white in the bubble that’s supposed to be dark, which I hastily try to eliminate-<br>
“Time’s up!”<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT THE HECK. NO WAY.</b> My heart practically stops from massive relief. Had I had one minute less, this would’ve been an insane disaster.<br>
Miracle #4.<br>
<br>
12 answers bubbled in. Success. Didn’t have time to guess the last 3, but I would’ve guessed <b>024</b> for all of them anyway lmao.<br>
<br>
I don’t even hear what the proctor is saying, because I am frantically looking over the bubbles to make sure none of them are in the wrong place. Just a quick sanity check.<br>
<br>
Apparently I’m supposed to sign my name, which I do. It’s very shaky. Because there is barely anyone in the room (only my brother and I are taking the aime), I barely even notice when the proctor is suddenly right in front of me, and I’m supposed to hand in my scantron sheet and scratch paper… I can’t take my eyes off of those answers; I have not gazed at them long enough to know I have not misbubbled. But oh well, whatever.<br>
<br>
The first thing I say to my brother and my mom is that “I finished bubbling in the last bubble right when time was called.” I also make a blog post about that, because in the spur of the moment the amount of relief is so insane that I cannot think about anything else.<br>
<br>
I compare a few answers with my brother in the car, but the fact that we got different answers on almost everything (well he also only attempted 5 questions) certainly does not ease my nervousness. I can only hope that I get at least an 8…</div> (contains spoilers by the way)<br>

			<div class="message">It's really sad to see ppl leave the math community.<br>
<br>
Ever since I was little my parents have always told me to do math for fun. There's no point forcing yourself to do something you don't find fun.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, to be in this situation I was just extremely lucky.<br>
<br>
It turns out that way too many parents and students only care about scores. Hence giving people the incentive to flex and cheat, and also taking the <i>fun</i> out of math comps. Somehow the focus ends up being 10% about the actual problems themselves, and 90% about the various people who took it.<br>
<br>
My parents also talked about eastern Europe having a vastly different culture in which everyone <i>likes</i> math, or at least math is viewed as a <i>for-fun</i> thing instead of an "ew" thing or an extremely competitive thing. It was the type of thing you do in your free time, like crossword puzzles. They also compared it to a shopping cart: I should be able to go myself without a push. I shouldn't <i>need</i> any pressure to go, and they weren't going to give me any. We may think of people who do math casually and leisurely as not serious, but in reality their mindset is better than that of most students and parents in the USA: grind to reach a goal.<br>
<br>
Although grinding can definitely be very useful, many of the top mathletes (holden, luke, etc) never really referred to their math practice as grinding. If you truly love something that much, it shouldn't even feel like a grind - it should be relaxing. I have yet to reach this level.<br>
<br>
The only problem is, to reach this level, quite a few things have to be the case: You must stop focusing on contest scores, give up on the <i>desire to win</i>, and most importantly, not have a ton of pressure from parents or peers, (which requires not going to one of the best schools in the nation).<br>
<br>
Now, about ppl leaving the math community: I think ppl leave the math community for 2 reasons; burning out, and discouragement.<br>
<br>
It's really sad to see when people burn out, but it's even more sad to see them become discouraged. Especially people you've known for years and basically grew up with.<br>
<br>
Knowing how badly one of the most good things in the world, math, can affect people's lives.<br>
<br>
All of this is attributed to the insane amount of pressure parents give to children, (and not even just their own). All of it.<br>
<br>
We only have a small fraction of our lives to participate in math comps, and actually FOCUS on comp math (unless you become a research professor). Later on we will live in dorms, and have jobs, etc.<br>
<br>
This is the golden age, and for this to be cut short, is just a missed opportunity.<br>
(Most) parents seem to view it as a time to grind 24/7, but in reality you should be trying to figure out what you love and where you have potential. Except that this ugly thing called getting into college exists.<br>
<br>
I really hate how one span of three hours can change everything.<br>
<br>
Especially because one's score is not even purely a function of skill. It's about half skill, combined with amount of outside pressure. AIME is no longer about math; it's about controlling one's emotions and psychologically eliminating the pressure that's going on inside. (For those who <i>do</i> have to worry about this, ofc.)<br>
<br>
One last thing: I'm pretty narrow minded, but I think the math community is one of the most wonderful things you can find out there. Ignoring the toxicity (which definitely stems from pushy parents), one of the greatest things about this place is that the high level people aren't even scary. They'll talk to you like normal people, and it's not even that hard to reach them - they are not all hidden away in small pockets of the community. People here try to help each other, even though we are each other's greatest competitors, and that's what creates huge Discord servers to hang out during covid. That's what creates such good student-run math comps and math orgs.<br>
<br>
Though I know that for many people, the peer pressure is high and you know inside what you should really be doing. No one knows best other than you, and to make the right decisions at the right times is truly a valuable skill.<br>
<br>
I can't really make anyone stay in the math community, nor can I fully sympathize given my situation, but I do wish that more people had the chance to keep doing math, for fun, and to enjoy the wonders of a community as great as this one. There's nothing like it out there.</div>

For most of my life, making mop had been my life goal. I remember thinking to myself in 9th grade, if only I can make mop, then my life will be complete. Well I did, sooner than expected, and I was not content; so I aimed for egmo. I convinced myself egmo would be my life goal, and made it, and believe it or not, I am still not content.<br>
And that's why the world is warped, because I imagine things as either above or below me. And egmo has always been way above me, and now it is below. So the world is really warped, and I'm in a really confused place, and I don't know where I am or where to go next.<br>
Some various goals, <b>90% of which I will not achieve</b>: jmo hm, jmo winner, do decently on egmo<br>
I can't think of more (and don't really want to) but these are all really short term and I need to at some point figure out what I actually want to do</div><br>

Well yes, because the higher level you go the more normal it is to flex/act like a normal person so like in one part of the math community its completely normal to flex and nobody takes it the wrong way, and orz culture is very much frowned upon. But actually no, because in the larger part of the math community it might come across as very conceited, and orzing is completely natural. So I actually don't know.</div><br>

		<div class="entrywrap">

			<div class="message">let's discuss the lousy job that MAA has been doing for frankly forever but most apparent this year. I should have really written this for my argumentative letter that I had to do in AP Lang, where we had to address a person or in this case an organization on a real world problem...<br>
<br>
First, the scores. Recently MAA has gotten slower and slower with the scores. Back in the early and mid 2010s, MAA was quite consistent in delivering scores, but ever since COVID struck and even a bit before COVID the time between the tests and results has been way too long. We all remember the long wait and delays that happened this spring, but this fall has been not in the slightest better. In fact, the broken promises they have made to us over the past few months are arguably even worse. MAA told everyone that AMC was moved to the fall in order to give seniors an opportunity to utilize their scores in college applications, but at this point it seems even more likely that the change was made so they could have a longer period to grade.<br>
<br>
This excessive time for grading is even more scandalous given the movement of AMC to the online platform on AoPS. It is at least in a least bit understandable for MAA to take a few weeks to grade tens of thousands and scantrons, but given that most of the testing has moved online, is this really acceptable anymore? What is further disconcerting is the fact that MAA has a complete lack of transparency. Rather than let the public know about the reasons behind repetitive delays and pushbacks, MAA keeps on breaking their promises as if it were something expected.<br>
<br>
MAA has demonstrated that they are capable of quickly returning results. Students in China and beyond have received their scores immediately after taking the test. Yet for whatever reason MAA refuses to do the same for us students in the US. It is with the same sort of hypocrisy that I could refute Vivian's argument that the reason NB and Female students remain behind in STEM; if it can happen there, why not elsewhere?<br>
<br>
Now for the personal experience. Firstly there was the error when MAA sent back many score reports from LAST YEAR, which is a silly enough mistake by itself. Moreover, my score report from THIS YEAR is also wrong. Upon looking at my results, I was told that I had gotten a 90, obtained from 15 Correct, 10 Wrong. This is definitely wrong, and I am sure they have confused my results with another student with similar last name. I left 4 questions blank, and was pretty confident that I had scored a 108 when checking with the answers I remembered from the contest. But what am I to do? I told my competition manager that I had probably fell victim to a mixed up score, but he implied it was my fault and that there was nothing he could do. Neither could I simply make a baseless accusation that my score was confused with another student with a similar name, which I think is possible. This is the worst possible situation a student could be in, and none of us should have to deal with this sort of mix-up.<br>
<br>
MAA has consistently disappointed me in more than one aspect. Due to its faults in the past year, I find myself not only angered but also helpless in even getting the score I deserve. I hope that in the future, students can take part in the AMCs with a far more transparent,  timely, and overall more enjoyable process.</div>

			<div class="message"><span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">way overdramatized summary that I wrote shortly after it ended (ft. me struggling for 3 hrs on an ez geo)</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">12:00<br>
<br>
My proctor (different proctor as last 2 times) gave me the problems and a huge stack of answer sheets which I was kinda surprised about since the other proctor hadnt given me any answer sheets. Then I was alone in the room for the next 4.5 hours.<br>
<br>
I immediately scanned the paper for any geo, and <b><i>#2 WAS GEO!</i></b><br>
<br>
<i>#2 geo?!</i> It literally could not have been any better. #1 was a decent looking combo, while #3 was disgusting (but not like I had a shot anyways). CG_-- are you actually serious? <i>This was my dream distribution.</i><br>
<br>
I tried #2 for about half an hour and unfortunately didn't get anywhere. It didn't look too scary though, like it wasn't a config geo with 10 million points or anything. I had no idea what to do at first, so I tried some length chasing, spiral similarity, analyzing what sort of triangles A_1B_1C_1 could be, drawing the medial triangle, and many other useless things. Pretty much the only useful thing I did was reflecting A_1, B_1, C_1 over B_1C_1, A_1C_1, A_1B_1 respectively and finding the cyclic quads, but then I got stuck there. Eventually I got kinda tired (because you know when you try for a while and don’t get anywhere on a problem and are kinda in the give-up stage.) I wondered if I should have maybe brought a compass because my diagram was pretty crappy.<br>
<br>
<i>But I had to do #2 by the end of these 4.5 hours, because I was literally a geo main! I could not let my <strike>nonexistent</strike> geo skills fail me. This wasn’t even a complicated looking geo problem; it looked so simple!!</i><br>
<br>
I very stupidly started doodling on my paper as if it would help me figure out the problem; it didn’t and I only became more distraught. I read the motivational quotes on the walls of the office I was in; they were <i>very</i> motivating. I realized I had been doing basically nothing for over half an hour.<br>
<br>
12:45<br>
<br>
After a lot of debating, I decided to stop struggling on #2 and try #1 because it was probably doable and I needed to get it out of the way. Immediately it reminded me of IMO 2009/6 (the mines thing) which was a required 9 pointer in DCY-induct that I had been doing a day ago, though it turned out to be nothing like that problem.<br>
<br>
Fortunately I found the right idea relatively quickly. After kicking around the obvious thing I needed to prove which looked like easy induction but it somehow took me half an hour, I was finally done and very relieved.<br>
<br>
2:00<br>
<br>
I finished writing up #1, and then went back to #2, because #3 just looked plain impossible.<br>
<br>
Once I looked at my diagrams for #2 again, my brain was refreshed and not tired anymore. I deleted the medial triangle cluttering up the diagram. Then I realized something really sus: the degree to which A_2B_2C_2 was rotated inside A_1B_1C_1 looked exactly the same. Well that was pretty neat. I needed to somehow prove that these rotations were the same.<br>
<br>
I realized that the orthocenter of A_1B_1C_1 was the Miquel Point of (AB_1C_1), (BA_1C_1), (CA_1B_1), and that these 3 circles were the same size. I tried to figure out how to configure 3 congruent circles like that so their Miquel Point is the orthocenter of the triangle inside, which didn’t really work and only made me suspect that A_1B_1C_1 had to be the medial triangle, which was completely false.<br>
<br>
And how to translate the equidistant condition? I realized that A_2A = A_2A_1 = A_2A_x, but what use does the circle centered at A_2 passing through A do??<br>
<br>
I checked the clock; it was about 2:30. Less than half of time was left.<br>
<br>
<i>But I absolutely had to finish this problem. I could not walk out the room with another 7. This was literally my ideal distribution; there was no way I could fail. I had no chance at EGMO because of my trash other 2 tstst day scores, but whatever. I still had to redeem myself on this one.<br>
<br>
It was raining outside, and I realized that my bike helmet was probably getting soaked. Stupid me!<br>
<br>
I swear, if this really used bary… I will go insane if there is a bary solution. I’m much to lazy to read EGMO Chapter 7 before every contest… </i><br>
<br>
I looked around the room for more inspirational quotes. I only read a few more, saving the last few for when I would really need them.<br>
<br>
Then it somehow occurred to me that A_2A = A_2A_1 ==&gt; A_2AA_1 was isosceles. So I somehow only needed to prove that A_2AA_1 was equal to the measure of the curvature (idk why I thought of this word) angle between A_1B_1C_1 and the medial triangle. But AA_2A_1 was not easy to calculate; it equaled AA_2B_1 + A_xA_2B_1, which looked extremely ugly; definitely not an option.<br>
<br>
<i>I needed to keep figuring stuff out, or else I would fall into the giving-up stage again like I had in the first half hour. Even if it wasnt something big.<br>
<br>
It was still raining outside, and it was around 3:00. Under 2 hours left, holy- that was scary. This was my one chance to get &gt;=2 problems on the tstst though. I couldn’t waste it.<br>
<br>
I was now much too stressed to doodle on my paper. I frantically looked around the room for more inspirational quotes, and read basically all of them except a few. I also stared at the posters of colleges on the walls (because this was the college counselors office).</i><br>
<br>
<b><i>LIFE OR DEATH, [NAME]! WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?<br>
<br>
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE IN THE NEXT ~MONTH, AND YOU’RE FRICKING WASTING IT?!</i></b><br>
<br>
I was currently defining A_2, B_2, C_2 as the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of AA_x with B_1C_1, etc because the perpendicular bisectors of AA_1, etc were just too ugly to think about. I realized the centers of (AB_1C_1), (BA_1C_1), (CA_1B_1) formed a triangle similar to ABC and in the same orientation. Hmm that was interesting, but no use- what do these centers even have to do with anything?<br>
<br>
<i>Even though it was very quiet, I could hear a little bit of commotion outside; it was around 3pm and school was being let out. I wished I was one of those students walking around; the pressure was unbearable.<br>
<br>
It was still raining outside.<br>
<br>
It felt as if the world was on fire. I wondered what would happen if the school did go on fire right now. Then I would have to escape and wouldnt be able to finish the tstst, so I should probably hurry up.</i><br>
<br>
I swear there was probably a spiral similarity in here (because bruh, the triangles are literally similar and shifted, what else could it be). Spiral similarity ==&gt; Miquel points; I had already tried that. Bruh, I thought I knew spiral similarity; why couldn’t I do this?!?!<br>
<br>
<b><i>LIFE OR DEATH.<br>
<br>
I’M LITERALLY GOING TO KILL YOU IF YOU DON’T FIGURE THIS OUT.</i></b><br>
<br>
I glanced at the clock; 3:15. Let’s not think about how much time is left.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I realized something really sus: the perpendicular bisectors of AA_x, BB_x, CC_x formed a triangle similar to ABC, as they should. Whoa. Was that true? I extended AA_x, BB_x, CC_x and drew their intersections. <b>What the heck. The triangle they formed had medial triangle ABC.</b><br>
<br>
I quickly proved this was true using some easy angle chasing.<br>
3:20; it finally felt as if I was onto something.<br>
<br>
Ok, what relevance did the perpendicular bisectors have though? They did seem connected to AA_2A_1 though, which was good. <b><i>WAIT WHAT THE HECK?! AA_2A_1 IS LITERALLY TWICE OF M_AA_2B_1. WHICH WE LITERALLY KNOW IS EQUAL TO M_BB_2C_1 AND M_CC_2A_1. (assuming M_A = midpoint of AA_x, etc). AND SO A_2AA_1 AND A_2A_1A ARE CLEARLY EQUAL TO THE CURVATURE \ALPHA.<br>
<br>
WHAT THE HECK I’M LITERALLY DONE.</i></b><br>
<br>
The time was 3:25 and suddenly I had a ton of energy and happiness. A week’s worth of happiness, all at once. So much so that not only my head, but my entire body, was filled with happiness. The greatest feeling on earth.<br>
<br>
3:25<br>
<br>
It was no longer raining outside; or so it looked like because the window was open. I read the last few inspirational quotes but was really not processing the information because I was too filled with happiness. (fyi I dont recall any of these because I think I was really preoccupied when reading them).<br>
<br>
<i>But bruh, was the solution really that easy?! It was literally just angle chasing. Are you serious?!<br>
I’m used to tstst 2’s being convoluted messes of high level techniques; how is this possible??</i><br>
<br>
After a few minutes the insane happiness kinda died down, and I realized I should probably write down my solution in case I fakesolved. I also realized this was the exact same vibe as jmo 2021/2. I was extremely happy that I solved it, but not extremely happy about the problem. I didn’t particularly like tstst 2021/8, actually. It was a meh problem with a way too easy solution, and that kinda took away from the great feeling of solving it, exactly like jmo 2021/2. But nonetheless I was still extremely happy.<br>
<br>
The writeup went well and I finished in about half an hour.<br>
<br>
4:00<br>
<br>
Part of the reason I was pushing myself so hard to do #2 was so that I would have time to at least attempt #3. I had the misconception that I could maybe get a point or two of partials by figuring out maybe a few things.<br>
<br>
But as soon as I read the problem and made sense of it, I immediately knew I would not get any partials. Bruh its alg and some really hard unit circle thing that I have completely no clue about. Being too lazy to check my other two solutions (and I had pretty much convinced myself that my solutions were right, and didn’t want to consider the possibility of fakesolving and becoming depressed), I took out an answer sheet for #3 and began to write random stuff, like De Moivre’s theorem. (Yep, thats pretty much the extent of my algebra knowledge.)<br>
<br>
Then I drew the MAA logo on my paper (I had pretty much had it memorized since I was 6 because once I was bored while doing math and realized there was an MAA logo on my piece of scratch paper and started coloring it), wrote some math subject bias thing and then considered attempting drawing a comic but decided it would be too corny so I just drew a cartoon shrugging.<br>
<br>
I literally had no chance on this problem ok<br>
Was this a mistake? I convinced myself not.<br>
<br>
4:20<br>
<br>
Well seems like I had 10 minutes left; my proctor came in to remind me. I had absolutely no clue what to do, but I knew I should keep attempting the problem even if I have no idea, or else I’m wasting a chance. So I wrote some completely random things on the answer sheet such as that it had something to do with the totient function (alg and nt <i>combined</i>, def not my favorite).<br>
<br>
Then I wrote “keep smiling” on the top of the paper because don’t judge, I think I had caught a happiness disorder ever since 3:25 or smth.<br>
<br>
4:30<br>
<br>
My proctor collected the answer sheets, thankfully didnt judge my questionable submission for the last problem, and also took away my 2 pieces of scratch paper (which I was praying he would let me keep so that I could keep the various #2 diagrams but thats illegal oops so whatever.) I was still pretty darn happy, but was slowly accepting the fact that #2 wasn’t like a killer or anything, so solving it wasn’t <i>that</i> impressive despite what I wished lmfao. And after all, it was my ideal distrib: CG_. I could only be thankful that I hadn’t done any worse. : )</div><br>
well just got my results back almost got a heart attack because I had (mis)heard they hadnt even started grading and expected them to only be out a week from now and then I saw the email<br>
well <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">28</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">700070770 :rofl:</div> total so I have literally no chance at egmo because rip the first 2 tststs i kinda threw tehm but whatever<br>
lets just say id MUCH rather the team do well than me making the team and dragging the US down lel<br>
my hearts still beating really fast fsr<br>
<br>
Edit: what the heck I just realized the only problems i solved on the tstst's were geo and combo AKA the only subjects I can do<br>
<br>
Edit 2: well its ironic looking back &amp; realizing how seriously I took this was the only reason I qualed for egmo</div>

			<div class="message">of the things I've tried so far, olympiad geo is by far the most painful, unintuitive, tricky thing I've ever done.<br>
<br>
okok I really suck at <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">combo</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">my cousin often zooms your local sweat for math help on school combo and yet I still get confused on the distinguishable indistinguishable double counting arrangements formulaic stuff</div> but that's different; I don't try at combo haha. Yet I <b>try</b> on Geo and yet I still suck.<br>
<br>
I feel like the reason Olympiad Geo is so difficult is that it is so free. It sounds ridiculous, but I think the reason I am pretty decent at Olympiad Algebra is that it requires some creative thought, yet there is somewhere to start. For example, for inequalities, I use a very epic technique affectionately referred to as dumbassing: you simply use your judgement and apply the following few techniques:<br>
<br>
1) AM-GM<br>
2) Muirhead<br>
3) Cauchy<br>
4) Holder<br>
5) Jensen<br>
6) Karamata<br>
7) TLT<br>
8) n - 1 EV<br>
<br>
optional: rearrangement/wpm/titu although I have never used those techniques on a problem<br>
<br>
in some order and with some manipulation. That's it. As Evan Chen has said, inequalities are just "regurgitating the same few techniques". Functional equations are a bit more oblique, but there are similar starting points: substituting things that make a lot of terms cancel (the battle cry "DURR WE WANT STUFF TO CANCEL"), proving injectivity or surjectivity, guessing solutions, etc.<br>
<br>
Even computational geometry has more to start with than olympiad geo. In computational, you already have numbers to work with, so worse case scenario you can calculate some lengths and angles you think will be useful (which can help you motivate further progress), coord bash, or even make some educated guesses. In olympiad geometry, you have NONE of that to work with, and the diagrams are much more complicated. This makes everything just a nightmare.<br>
<br>
Personal experience is I haven't really solved any olympiad geometry problems without some sort of support whether its drawing diagrams on paint (which is a bit easier than on paper), using geogebra, or getting 50000 hints. For example, when solving IMO 2013 #4 for the OTIS applications, I used geogebra and got 9182409124 leads that went all over the place. It was a painful 5 days to solve just this benign 10 MOHS "easy" problem. Collinearity is extremely pathological so even during vacation I was highly worried that I had messed up and used the condition to prove the condition, which ofc I did several times. sorrY being realistic I'm in universal studios trying to enjoy life I don't need to worry about these 3 points being on a line. In the end, I did this extremely unintuitive weird angle chase that didn't use many of the leads except the main ideas of the configuration. It was pain, and tbh I'm still not sure if its even correct.<br>
<br>
anyone good at geo please teach me the magic of solving olympiad geo<br>
your helpful feedback is appreciated</div>

1. My dad randomly announced that he was going to go to Israel and apparently the only way to survive in Israel is to torture yourself?????? (Just a little bit, to be respectful or smth strange) So he was going to buy a torture stick and practice. At first only my dad and brother and Overlord123 (LOL) were going but then my whole family, plus Quacker88, decided to go. But then somehow we transported to China and my brother and I got separated from the rest of the ppl and we had to get on the train so idk, we just followed the rest of the ppl getting on the train and scanned our tickets and stuff but it also seemed like we were late so that was kinda bad. When we got to the final ticket counter I gave my ticket and the lady was talking in Chinese so I was trying my best to understand and then my brother says something and the lady starts LAUGHING. I ask the lady what happened and she says my brother keeps saying she is hot LMFAO. (In the dream my brother is a player and so is my dad (who is also blonde) and basically my whole family except me)<br>
2. We were at some sort of family reunion (btw I have literally never gone to a family reunion before) and I was dying my sister's hair but I was doing a very bad job and I kept dying different parts of it blonde, brown, blonde, etc because I was having too much fun. And then somehow there were these two finished puzzles one representing my whole life and the second, which was a map of Africa and the Middle East, representing this reunion and it was titled "everything" or something like that. And somehow my blog turned into a picture of these 2 pictures like they were supposed to symbolize something. Then bingo2016 (who is this 5th grader with a baby face and huge glasses and pigtails) messages me on the dc server (?) "I think the title of the second map implies 'i am no longer the center of attention' which is probably not what you wanted to imply" and I am horrified because thats not what I wanted to imply. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
3. I'm at home talking to my dad about smth and then my athemath students show up on the stairs, I guess I'm supposed to teach athemath now! But the next lesson is like newtons laws or something and the curriculum is really weird. Also im working for squareman on smth and everyone else but me is actually working like this very busy dude whose name looks a bit like math4life's submits stuff every day at 9pm his time and I'm like how<br>
<br>
1/16/22<br>
1. It was like the first day of 11th grade and I had apush and chinese, first I locked up my bike in some courtyard outside the classrooms and then in apush there were like 8 total students and none of us had done the reading properly LOL in chinese it was mostly me and the teacher talking and we mostly talked about toxicity in China<br>
2. We were telling stories in class and this one kid told a story about a guy who was stomping on the ground but it was painful ? So he decided to stomp on a bridge instead but then he broke the bridge and fell into the icy water and died</div><br>
<br>
was too lazy to write out dreams for a few days lmao<br>

			<div class="message">Once upon a time I was really close to my siblings, especially my brother. Really close, like we had the same interests and hobbies and everything. Somehow in the past 2 years that has changed, a lot.<br>
<br>
First of all my brother has always been better than me at science, in fact at basically everything stem-related except math. Which would have been good for him, except my parents literally only care about math. Its not even like they give us the choice of to do competitive bio or physics or math or coding etc, it just HAS to be math, because according to them math is what makes up everything (true, but still.)<br>
<br>
Which means that when my brother got really into coding (which I think is really good for him, unfortunately I know close to nothing about coding) my parents weren't particularly happy, they were unhappy that he wasn't doing enough math.<br>
<br>
Now part of the reason why he got into coding was probably actually because of me, cuz I was already into math and he probably wanted a way to feel good about himself by being able to do something his older sister can't do.<br>
<br>
But then my parents get mad at him for valuing coding over math, and I think there is no point of forcing someone to do math when they clearly don't enjoy it because they're not going to appreciate it and neither are you and this is what asian tiger parents do. (Even though when we were little my parents gave us lectures on why math was fun and amazing; these are long-gone)<br>
<br>
Well I am thankful and guilty for a few reasons:<br>
1.Had my brother not been here, I don't think I would have achieved half the things I've done. Basically, competition is motivation. The primary reason why I started my aime grind in 8th grade (which was my biggest step towards truly enjoying math and being self motivated) was because I realized my brother was probably better at geo than me, and I wanted to catch up. Basically he has given to me (albeit unknowingly) way too many times and I better return it sometime<br>
2. My brother often gets in trouble for being mean to my sister (who is younger than him) and while it's not nice, I think that in a way he is getting revenge for the times when I was mean to him. (Yeah I was pretty mean before ooops)<br>
3. My parents acting unfairly. I think a lot of the things they do are unreasonable, such as banning my brother from coding when it is literally the thing he is most good at and is most interested in. I get why they care so much about math, but my brother clearly won't become a math main in an instant and so why force him to waste lots of time doing "math" aka nothing when he could be being much more productive. Somehow I just really doubt he will suddenly have an epiphany like I did in early January 2020 and suddenly start grinding math.<br>
4. As much as I want to be a role model for my siblings, I think it is just going the wrong way in this case. If anything, I should be the opposite of a role model, since nothing im good at is anything he is really interested in. I don't want to be the one who brings him down. He really is a smart person, and for his non-math skills to be overlooked just because his sister is a bit better at math is just insanely stupid.<br>
<br>
I haven't actually been mean to my brother in a few years. Maybe this is a part of growing up. We have stopped telling on each other because I think there is a mutual understanding that we are/have been guilty of the same things (like listening to music, watching youtube, drawing on math papers, etc).<br>
<br>
I just hope that someday my brother will be accepted by our parents/grandparents and for once it will not be a crime not to like programming above math.<br>
<br>
<br>
With my sister it's a very different story.<br>
<br>
She's very into dancing, which is cool, but is also interested in math. I can tell that she is slightly more interested in dancing than math tho. She is very young tho, so it's very hard to tell. At that age my brother was also very interested in math. She also has social skills (way more than my brother or I did in 2nd grade) which I may have mentioned before- this may also correlate with the fact that she is able to dance lol idk. Anyway, she is very different from my brother and I too.<br>
<br>
I sometimes think that she's "lucky" in that for example, my parents would never have let me take dance classes in 2nd grade, cuz I was supposed to focus on math. I also had the urge to be like my brother at that age so idt I would've. But anyway, my parents are much less strict on her. I remember holding my baby sister in ~3rd grade while my brother was getting punished pretty badly and thinking "oh no I can't imagine you getting punished like that. It's too painful to imagine" well guess what, she never got punished like that. It's crazy to think about how much more lenient my parents have gotten in the past decade. Maybe that's just another rite of passage?<br>
<br>
But then she is also "unlucky" in that the less strict my parents are with like her doing stem and stuff, the less she will be compelled to do it, and knowing how much my parents still care about math that may not end up well. But who knows? She might be the next dance+math prodigy like Janabel, its too early to know.<br>
<br>
All in all, I'm very thankful for my siblings and I most definitely would not have come this far without them. I hope that someday my parents will know that math isn't the only thing (and that forcing someone to do math is definitely not usually effective) and that someday I'll be able to repay them for all that they've provided me.<br>

1. My sister and I were going on a trip across the country, somehow we ended up in Palo Alto CA and went to a family friends house at 5am without telling them. Somehow the door was unlocked so we went in, proceeded to build some Lego thing to give them, but we were trying to be really quiet so we wouldn't wake them up. Then we heard a toilet flush from upstairs and got really scared cuz we thought they were waking up (at 5am) so I dragged my sister outside and we drove away (somehow my 7 y/o sister can drive.) Also their house was really weird there were empty beds on the first floor so at first we thought they were not at home. So then we start driving around Palo Alto and it's really weird, there are like moving benches that are also scooters so you can ride them and there are also huge circular tour buses that you hold onto and somehow my sister obtains a mens suit so she can disguise herself. Also at some point I read mathicorn's new blog post and she immediately dms me "heyyy congrats u were the first one to read my blog post"<br>
<br>
2. (warning: sensitive content??) It had been announced on the news that there was a 2nd "holocaust" but this time for everyone, not just Jewish ppl.. so we all had to get into our cars and go to Germany. It was really sad right before leaving we saw a family we knew and they were telling the youngest child "you're not going to survive"... But they weren't crying nobody was crying it was really weird. But then we were all supposed to drive to Germany (which was apparently like 300 miles away) so we drove there and then were put in some sort of trailer. I was expecting to get tortured but they didn't torture us yet, in fact the people looked pretty normal. They were throwing white packages of food at us (which somehow actually contained sticky rice cakes ?) but I wasn't eating any because I was saving them for my family cuz I thought we wouldn't have any food later. But they just kept giving us food, it was so weird, and soon we had extra. And the people giving us food didn't look SO mean and there is wasnt any sign of ppl being killed so we all decided to go inside some circular building where there were other ppl and asked them "how many ppl are u bringing here" and the lady answered "idk, a lot??" It really didn't seem like anybody knew what they were doing, or that it was a holocaust at all. So then I basically wandered around this circular building and some ppl from school asked me to play a song on the second floor on piano and somehow I knew how to play piano??<br>
<br>
*Note: I do not in any way undermine the terrible depravity of the Holocaust; only in this dream were things extremely warped. <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
1/12/22<br>
<br>
1. All the middle and high schoolers in my school were now doing school in a huge mansion and I was trying to do a math problem abt the number of ways for the 6th graders to do smth.. then one of the science teachers told me I was trash at science and I got banned from taking science. But then somehow I snuck into some chemistry class and answered a question right so I was allowed again<br>
<br>
2. We had gone to the pediatrician but we went in the wrong door and somehow there were like no employees (because of covid?) but there were a few ppl in the waiting room and somehow my mom knew all of them and then I was shaking hands with this one 3 yr old who had the same size hands as me<br>
<br>
1/11/22<br>
<br>
1. I had gone to irl MOAA with my family just to watch (I couldn't participate cuz I was too old) and apparently like 50% of the contestants were athemath ppl, we told ali her dream had finally come true, anyway during the first round (individual, 10 questions) I was talking out loud with my brother about the problems and apparently the last one was trivial by base 9 or smth (it was like which of these numbers is attainable by repeatedly multiplying by 9 and adding 2) and then one of the organizers asked us what we thought of the problems and I said it was good except the lack of geo (and I had accidentally overlooked the fact that #7 was geo). The entire time this was in the same room as the MOAA participants :concern:<br>
<br>
2. My brother and I went to pick up my sister from the elementary school (apparently she was in 4th grade and recently got a buzz cut because she wanted to and now her face looked like a younger version of my 8th grade English teacher's) and then we went with some MAST people to this music museum to hunt for signs of mathicorn?? And we found a few songs with "mathicorn" in them, including one from "mathicorn" to "cylence", idek why these were in the music museum, but we had to be very careful not to wake mathicorn up because she was also in the museum and sleeping (cuz it was night??). At the end she kinda woke up but was still unconscious so we lay down on the ground and pretended to sleep (because we would be completely dead if she woke up) and she ended up going back to sleep, around 550 am we went to my house and ate food and that was the end</div><br>
<br>
if i sounded high while writing this I probably was at 11pm</div>

My sister and I were doing some dangerous science experiment involving fire at home; we were supposed to be extracting O3 somehow; it was like part of my online school; and then suddenly I had a vision of my mom and dad when they met at caltech and a second later they came home and we kinda got in trouble XD<br>
2. First I was doing some math problems with pbc.. forget which ones.. then I was trying to speedrun a DC exam and I did all the geo except #19 which was actually caroline2023's problem and it involved an equilateral hexagon inscribed inside another hexagon except the vertices of the hexagon represented people so it was a word problem like "there are some mothers at a christmas party, if their kids upstairs first keep what they want for christmas secret.. and then reveal them later after some conditions.. how many of them will know what their kids want for christmas" it made no sense at all and I couldn't figure out the answer XD<br>
3. I was zoombombing one of the other TAs' class.. I set my pfp to a picture of a little kid (except ofc it wasn't realistic cuz the picture wasn't moving) and somehow my name became "(he/she) [something] mole" which ofc was sus but anyway. The class was almost over but somehow there was a break (and one of the TA's was going swimming in her house?) so I started saying random stuff in a little kid voice.. eventually I stopped being obnoxious and left the zoom meeting<br>
<br>

1. Dont remember much but I do remember outside our house there was this really tall flower "tree" and if u pick flowers from it then they grow back. Then my family was visiting our neighbor's house because it was being sold and first of all it looked very different from ours even though we live in a duplex; there was an elevator taking u to floors 1, 2, 4 and there was another "flower tree" in in the backyard except it looked way different, there was a really tall green stem that looked like celery and then a huge ring of flowers at the top inside of which there was a lot of ribbon. Then my sister was shaking the tree and the ribbon and some of the flowers fell down, my mom was very mad at her because apparently the flowers did not grow back once they fell off.<br>
<br>

1. So im at school waiting for my mom to pick me up since its very cold outside but the freshmen are being very annoying and cutting their hair with this hair-cutting machine which does a very bad job of hair cutting. So they all have very disgusting haircuts<br>
2. I was walking down the road with my mom when it turned into a bridge over a lake and my mom says "its a cross between Cavendish and New York" and then the bridge somehow turns into a ladder down to our house and there are toothbrushes on the ground</div><br>
pretty low quality because I've been getting some pretty low quality sleep oops (I stayed up late to do an easy Induct problem let's just say it took over an hour when it could've taken 20 minutes my brain just decides to go at 0.3 speed after like 930<br>
I also need to get my priorities straight lmao fsr otis is always highest on my priorities list and so I am very behind in things such as testsolving and mocking (oopss)<br>
And I haven't even been doing otis units *that* quickly school is just too time consuming<br>
(oh and I waste a lot of time doing random stuff with my sister)<br>
<br>
Well time to attempt to wake up at 430 to study for a history test first period that I haven't studied for yet yaay<br>

			<div class="message">I think the main thing standing in the way of female/nb ppl in math is social media<br>
ever wonder why the former are better at math until ~age 12 and then it flips? because they discover social media<br>
certain parts of social media sites communicate the completely wrong message*<br>
and it's just a fact that female/nb ppl are more drawn to social media (in particular tiktok, instagram) than boys because peer pressure exists<br>
And no im not one of those ppl who grinds math 8 hrs a day and doesn't use social media I spend way too much time on discord** and sometimes get carried away on instagram for a few hours (specifically right after I submit an otis unit oops) &lt;- but like completely obliterating social media is kinda a nice way to go mentally insane so like don't do that<br>
<br>
but I used to be a youtube addict once, also was once an instagram reel addict, and lemme tell u, the times in which I was addicted to social media in the last ~3 yrs correlated directly with the times in which I progressed the least in math<br>
eventually I had an epiphany - the reason <i>why</i> female/nb ppl fall behind boys at this age was because of exactly what was happening to me, and so I should stop immediately or else I would fall behind<br>
(not like im a good role model but these are just my experiences)<br>
<br>
*like that female/nb ppl are inherently dumb and so there's no reason to try to be smart<br>
ive also observed this in my chemistry class lmao<br>
like there are these girls behind me and they usually answer questions wrong and when one of them actually gets the right answer the other ones go "OKAY [name]! OKAY! OKAY!" kinda like <i>wow ur such a nerd you actually knew the answer??</i> but not exactly that. and it doesnt happen with boys whenever a boy gets the right answer everyones like "okay stronk"<br>
this happens in history class too and probably everywhere else; its almost like dumbness is "admirable"<br>
<br>
**ok theres something really different about discord as supposed to instagram<br>
looking only at the math community, well, discord actually has math ppl and instagram doesn't (speaking bluntly)<br>
i know this because advertising math things on instagram is about as successful as eating soup with chopsticks<br>
and the best way to get good at something is, to be surrounded with tons of other ppl with the same goals as u<br>
ever wonder why bay area is so good? bc it has such a big community<br>
<br>
I discovered this person called <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">Jenny Nuo</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">(I havent actually listened to any of the music oops but I googled her)</div> a few months ago from reading jiajia's blog and I thought BRUH, THE WORLD NEEDS MORE PPL LIKE THIS<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">oh yea we also need a female 3b1b</div><br>
THE BEST WAY TO GET FEMALE/NB INTO MATH IS TO CREATE MORE JENNY NUOS BUT REPLACE COMPUTER PROGRAMMING WITH MATH, PERIOD<br>
<br>
<b>IM NOT SAYING THAT TO BE A SUCCESSFUL FEMALE/NB IN MATH U HAVE TO NOT USE SOCIAL MEDIA;</b> IN FACT THERE ARE SOME REALLY REALLY SUCCESSFUL PPL (pravi, connie, etc) WHO DO SPEND TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA (BUT WISELY OFC) AND THATS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE<br>
BUT IF U WANT TO GET SERIOUS WITH MATH, THE <b>DEFINITE EASIEST</b> WAY IS JUST TO LIKE, DECREASE 3 HRS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO 1<br>
AND ITLL MAKE A DIFFERENCE <span class="bbfont-three-q">also join mast and otis!!</span><br>
<br>
I really hope I didnt offend anyone but if I did then hmu; after all this <i>was</i> in the list of "really controversial things to write blog posts about" in my private discord server<br>
kinda got carried away writing this if I seem like a radical feminist!!!</div>

1. First I'm playing this game on miro with other ppl in the TA server where u have to click on territory to claim it but apparently Scandinavia is the only region that exists and im losing badly because I can't click (I kept losing Sweden and Finland which for some reason look identical), then I go upstairs to go to bed and apparently something weird is happening with the date, it's 12/27 again when new year was just a few weeks ago. My siblings and I are hanging out in the bedroom and my brother asks me what my favorite song was 3 years ago, I have no idea but I say I think it contained the letters d and v but somehow my sister knows and is laughing at me. Then they go to sleep and I start doing a mock jmo at like midnight, I solve all the problems just as time runs out but then I realize I had completely misread problem 3, it actually had some small footnote at the bottom and the real question statement had 2 parts, one of the parts was like "is having a greater circumference of the cloth worth it?" And the problem was about clothing so "greater circumference" actually meant u have a greater circumference when u wear it, it made NO sense at all. Then somehow I acquired some pieces of bread (from thanksgiving dinner, apparently) with different circumstances and began to eat the breadstick like it would help me with the math problem. Then my mom comes upstairs to move stuff, she is apparently awake because my granddad is awake and making a new "bed" for himself which is actually a tiny piece of foam. I stopped doing both the jmo and eating the breadstick because I'm not supposed to be eating upstairs. Well my mom is organizing things throughout the house and when I go downstairs everything looks exactly the same as it did 2 years ago?? And my brother is coding downstairs he is somehow already awake, the console looks like overleaf though. But he is not very happy because with the current setup u cannot see his monitor screen but with the 2 yrs ago setup you could xDDD so he is having an argument with my mom...<br>
<br>
2. My siblings were having an argument; then somehow they cloned and ran around in circles so there were many of each of them. Then somehow I cloned too, so there were like 4 of my sister and 2 of my brother and 4 of me. Anyway since there were less copies of my brother than my sister, we concluded that my sister had won the argument. Then all of my family except me went to visit my mom's stepmother (who is actually dead) and my dad's granddad, who were apparently married to each other, but the latter had a paralyzed hand and the former looked like a 20 year old she had like a pixie cut and dyed blonde hair. Anyway they looked very happy. Then my family came back and we went to church and saw this family from church with like 6 kids that we had not seen since 2019, the youngest one was a little baby who was trying to climb up his dad's shirt. Then the mom got a call from someone and the whole family went to move boxes and attend to malaria patients, which we went to help them with... then I kinda woke up because I didn't want to look at malaria patients<br>
<br>
1/3/22<br>
<br>
1. It was the night of new years eve but I was stuck on a combo problem so I couldn't sleep until midnight and then I heard cheering from the mast discord server cuz it was the new year and that finally put me to sleep.<br>
<br>
2. I was so stuck on a combo problem that I had to get alifenix to help, who said "what have you figured out so far" and I replied "nothing" and then she put up an athemath add on my bathroom mirror because apparently all the athemath ppl were moving into my house. Also my zoom background (?) was the US capital but very zoomed in, but I wanted to change it to an image of this other special building so I somehow teleported to that other building (it was like a famous art gallery) and walked around taking pictures<br>
<br>
3. This EGMO qualifier from a few years ago posted a review of mop 2019 (which had apparently happened in mid july) in aops c&amp;p and apparently the tstst was taken by both moppers and arml tiebreaker ppl  but there were a ton of arml tiebreaker ppl, like basically everyone in mast was one of them and I-_-I commented on the thread "it was really hot in the [tstst] room so I couldn't focus"<br>
The person who posted the thread also said in the review thing "The_Turtle did not socialize with anyone during meals, instead he played with turtles" so my siblings and I had somehow gotten hold of a box of pencils used by the girl who made that post but when we took them out they turned into magnets and my sister divided them up so that the green ones (representing turtles) were stuck together. Then my mom called us for lunch and I was seriously dreading writing up some otis sols on overleaf which is actually true irl.<br>
<br>
1/2/22<br>
<br>
1. So uh my siblings and I were really worried that our mom was evil (we also had a stepdad idk what happened to our real dad) so we ran away from home but we didn't get far, it was like 9pm at night and my sister was on a school field trip so I ran to a nearby field and my brother biked, we passed by my sister along the way and brought her with us so we all went to the field along with some other family who had apparently become curious as to where we were going? except my mom had realized we were gone and she and our stepdad soon found us in the field cuz the field was very close to our house so we were kinda ded and she brought us back home. (We realized that if she hadn't found us she would've called 911 and found us eventually so rip) Then I checked discord and someone had drawn a Christmas tree with weird red spikes in this one group chat and it had made cornie triggered and redflame was like "well there's only one person who lives in the 7 mile range" implying that I had drawn it but I quickly replied "NO IT WASNT ME!" cuz I actually hadn't. Then I got a dm from squareman asking if I could write geo and I replied "only bad geo" and immediately got on geogebra and began to write some bad geo involving orthocenters. Then squareman said "well then u can be the geo writer since stephanie is absolutely cracked at AI" (because ofc ommc needs AI crackheads.) Then I saw a paper on my desk which was a picture of this spy dude (he looked like a ninja in the picture) and he somehow came to life and my siblings and I decided he should spy on my mom which he agreed to. I think we went outside again but it kinda failed<br>
<br>
2. I was on a high ropes course but it was also a sport at the same time like there were these little balls being thrown everywhere but I didn't have a ball or helmet or any gear so it was pretty sad they had to throw me a ball (which I only caught on the 3rd try) and a helmet to put on in the middle of the ropes course which was kinda dangerous cuz I was like in the middle of ascending a wall. Also I was surrounded by screaming 8 yr olds which was kinda weird. I was also carrying a big (mostly empty) duffel bag which said on the side "if you're ever traveling long distance by foot in the safaris of Africa then just bring fruit and nuts because it's light and you'll need the energy"<br>
<br>
3. My sister could not stop bugging me about how she was going to visit a ballet museum for a school field trip and it featured ballet dancers who were discriminated against or smth (my sister really likes dancing)<br>
<br>
1/1/22<br>
First of all I kept having dreams about waking up late (like past 6 etc) because I had to wake up early today to make surprise breakfast with my siblings LMAO and actually woke up a few times at 3, 4 soo<br>
<br>
1. There was like an ommc meeting at 4am and it was like on miro or smth but in order to join I had to logout of miro and otis-web? And I was rly sad about logging out of otis-web because I wouldn't be able to access arch and I somehow needed my parents permission to log back in. Then my parents came home at like 6am with a lot of uncooked buns (like the puffy ones with meat inside), apparently they had made them at the office, and my dad lost his keys to the house</div><br>
^clearly I just include these to make the boring post less boring <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>

			<div class="message">I don't really have a clear image of "goals" in my head.. I just have a nebulous array of "best case", "worst case", and "mediocre" scenarios and the really weird thing is, 90% of the time the outcome comes out "mediocre". I dont even know- whenever I outline a specific score that I would be elated about and a specific score I would be absolutely depressed about, I end up getting something right in the middle,, so I've decided to stop torturing myself with goals..............<br>
like I cant even say what I thought about mop before making it because back then I couldnt even think about it without going crazy and same for certain things now, such as mit, I just need to erase these things from my brain as much as possible<br>
<br>
random thought but I kinda wish I was cool and could play music.. but no, I cant <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
I have a %*(#@ ton of admiration for everyone who plays music, but epecially in the math community, because like how do u juggle two skills at once that's just beyond my level<br>
when I was younger I used to console myself by thinking that if I could play music it probably wouldn't be useful when I'm an adult unless I was a musician so it wouldn't be worth learning anyways<br>
but now I see that music is literally something spiritual and used for healing like quite literally a medicine, ok the epitome of this revelation came a few minutes ago (ok plz laugh at me im stupid) when I was reading <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1104108" class="bbcode_url" target="_blank">this post by pranav</a><br>
but yes, I really do wish that I had more skills like being able to play music (and yes, I have considered the possibility of learning now but it's way too late and I have like no time and I don't have money either) because what <i>have</i> I accomplished outside of math.. literally 0.<br>
I think this is just the stupid side of me wanting things that I don't have <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
I spent way too long reading the blogroll today (happens way too often tbh, blogroll is SO easy to get carried away on <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">)<br>
am currently trying to <i>process</i> how to churn out like 10 <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">process</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">like literally each problem takes ~15 min to write up and I'm just too lazy; I just have a pile of papers on my desk with all the ideas of the writeups istg combo writeups are beyond painful</div> writeups that I am procrastinating on and also my usamts writeups and also testsolving for various things and a few random other things</div>

			<div class="message">I used to accidentally write the previous year in the first few weeks after the new year but now I realize I've barely actually written the year 2021, at least not on paper. I used to have math notebooks where I wrote the date everyday and now i just use random pieces of scratch paper XD<br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">dreams</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">12/27<br>
<br>
1. It was irl mop and I was part of the 2 ppl (the other person might've been caroline2023) in singing troupe and it was rly awkward cuz we had to perform first or smth. We were singing a song about disney princesses.<br>
2. I was supposed to go into outer space in this little 350 lb spherical space orb but I didn't know how it worked so I had to figure it out myself. Apparently there's no oxygen tank the sphere is just initially filled with air and there's an air tight seal and u have to come back when there's no oxygen left LMAO. I did not end up figuring it out in time cuz I was just playing music and also I was rly scared.<br>
3. One of the improv comedy teachers, Kristen, died at 19 after getting burned to death in some sort of desert and we were all really sad<br>
4. We were on a ship of some sorts that was sinking, or at least there was weird stuff happening with the water level so my brother and I had to keep going up to the top level and fiddling with the controls but we didn't want anyone to know cuz we were just passengers so we had to do it in secret<br>
5. I was at school making cards for some Jewish victims?? And you were supposed to write it in a different language if you could, it was also a competition for who could make the best card. (Of course I couldn't win cuz I basically can only write English) Also someone was asking me "what's the pattern between number of edges of a tetrahedron in every dimension" and I had no clue<br>
6. All I know is that I dreamed I was trying to solve a geometry problem which I had literally actually solved the day before<br>
<br>
12/29<br>
<br>
1. My brother and I were discovering elements and the first 4 elements were literally names of ppl, one of them was overlord123, but we were like converting the element names into chinese and then I didn't know how to convert "aluminium" to chinese so I was googling its density<br>
2. It was the first day of school after winter break but I was late so I had to take this huge room sized elevator which had small rooms attached to it in which you could travel back in time to different decades, I didn't actually go into them but I ended up being really late to class. There were also escalators in the school instead of stairs<br>
<br>
12/31<br>
<br>
I woke up too late to actually remember my dreams but one of them was that jmo 2022 day 1 had a distrib like AGC, very much like jmo 2021 day 1, the first problem was a functional equation and the last one was combo geo and I was taking jmo on my bed upstairs and was rly excited cuz it was basically my ideal distrib but then I had to go downstairs to do smth so rip me.</div><br>
<br>
process is hard and I am dum<br>

<br>
January: joined <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">otis</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">however I barely talked in year vi cuz I was shy</div>, did a unit in like 2 weeks (very slow) and proceeded to get nothing done for the next like month i also mocked some aops amc's last minute but spent most of my time spamming cncm. o yea i took the potd pretty seriously. also was pretty addicted to instagram lmao. school at this time was just irrelevant. also there was probably a reaper game going on so i got very little sleep i had a crazy sleep schedule like 9-4 or smth<br>
<br>
February: pretty happy and rly surprised after completely fluking on both amc's, this cncm cdr thing was pretty interesting lmao. basically i was just a full on discord addict and i think i got like 1 otis unit done but barely any math other than potd :&gt; also i became pretty close with the "ivys" and found an obsession for impersonating ppl<br>
<br>
March: well first of all i died on the aime, definitely was not prepared, somehow qualified for jmo after being carried by amc score. pretty much died on every college comp /shrug. was still a huge cncm spammer and i caught on to all the biswadev stuff (maybe to fit in?) the ivys vs cncm staff battle was now in full intensity<br>
<br>
April: I barely practiced for jmo at all (I think I did otjmo and got 15 or smth) so the real jmo turned out very unexpected if not for jmo#2 being geo it would've turned out much differnet. I think I barely did anything in the week after jmo but then i started spamming jmo problems with a discord olympiad bot. I mightve also been addicted to instagram again. cncm april fools potd was pretty fun. i wrote a few problems by spamming random things on geogebra and joined the ommc committee<br>
<br>
May: ok this mightve been the height of my Life As A Discord Spammer, i somehow became cncm advisor even after completley clowning the interview. there was tons of aops drama on discord and it was definitely my prime source of entertainment. I started actually doing math (discord olympiad bot) during school but discord is too addicting! calc ap exam also happened and i thought i had died, I only prepped in like the week before oops. generally a very exciting month as the school year was coming to an end and I mostly built stronger relationships with the ivys, it became a bit of a cult..<br>
<br>
June: so reaper started again and i tried to be a reaper addict while also surviving mop maybe not the best idea :/ the reaper server was created and thats where... life took a turn for the worse. I was in a really weird position cuz it wasn't really clear who was my "friend" and "not friend" on discord anymore so by the end of this month i had basically given up distinguishing. this month was rly exhausting and i def didnt get enough sleep <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"> and mop was <i>interesting</i> (might write more abt that in another post) but it wouldve been much much different irl lol. also cncm kinda died over the summer rip<br>
<br>
July: reaper was still going and there was a ton of tension in the reaper server unfortunately i was in the middle of it, i should not have gotten myself into this mess lmao. we all just wanted reaper to end, which it finally did at the end of the month. I literlaly kept my computer open all day so i could run the reaper log code and it was pretty inconvenient cuz my parents dont like it when i leave my computer open XD. I think I did a little math (geo isl) but i was wayyy less productive than i couldve been <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> reaper is so time consuming. by the end of the month things had completely changed since may, I was still good friends with the "ivys" but we werent the "ivys" anymore, cuz yknow things wear off after a while and ppl had like gone back to their original discord usernames and stuff. tbh I didnt really know where i was headed anymore <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
August: otis vii started!!! and school started too!!! probably best month tbh. i got a lot more sleep now that reaper was over and spammed a ton of otis units in the first month, it was rly fun actually cuz u get a lot more done when theres an actual goal+reward. but the otis community was the best thing somehow I just hadnt integrated into the otis community in year vi but now that a lot of my friends were here i felt like I fit in much better........kinda foolish of me lol<br>
<br>
September: also a good month, i actually felt like i was getting stuff done lol. i was able to socialize a bit at school and also do a bit of math during school etc. however I wasnt sure if my efforts would actually pay off cuz there werent rly any competitions to prove myself through. i also started teaching at athemath and it was pretty nervewracking at first cuz i hadnt ever taught before but i got more used to it. oh yea and i also got banned from cncm that was kinda not good :/ And I left the reaper server on a whim which was actually a really really good thing.<br>
<br>
October: tbh i dont really remember what happened in this month other than that it was p good overall. I kept doing otis units although not as fast as I was in August, i think i had like a week of burnout once but picked myself up and just decided to do them slower. I think I spent more time in otis than mast now (pretty sure those were the 2 main servers I frequented) and i finally adequately distanced myself from aops drama<br>
<br>
November: I procrastinated on amc practice until a few days before, feverishly tried to spam aops mocks and it didn't go so well I crashed on the 10a but at least the 10b went better, luck smhh if not for that I probably wouldve been semi depressed for a month. tstst day 1 was also pretty sad and uh college comps were meh I dont' even remember which ones happened when. also my mom was out of town a lot cuz her parents were not in good health so it was kinda oof :/ but by the end of the month it was pretty much back to normal ! usamts (oops i didnt talk about this the whole post) is kinda disastrous but whatev:/<br>
<br>
December: still trying to do otis units at moderate pace but the ones that are left are pretty difficult so its going much slower now. fixed my sleep schedule so im finally not sleep deprived for the first time in like a year. athemath ended and the TA thing started, which was pretty nice the TA community is pretty fun. generally a chill month. no, i didnt do usaco cuz im kinda trahs at coding<br>
<br>
OK HOLY WHAT THAT TOOK LIKE HALF AN HOUR TO WRITE?!?%*(#*%@%*@#</div></div>

My siblings and I were COLLECTIVELY doing a mock jmo but we kept getting interrupted like we had to bake a cake in the middle or smth (and dream 3 happened in the middle also) anyway our mom was kinda mad at us because we weren't doing the jmo<br>
2. We had this jar of peanut butter at home but it was from like 1800 when Lincoln was not alive yet so it said "Nebraska butter" and apparently nowadays since Lincoln they have called peanut butter Lincoln butter anyways my mom said it was too dangerous to eat but we had a ton of jars of it so rip<br>
3. My family had these dolls but they were alive so the one old man doll was writing a letter to his wife who was on a ship (actually it might've been a will or smth) but he died while writing the letter like the was actually a dead body in our bathroom that I couldn't look at so we had to finish writing the letter for him<br>
4. I was in some huge room of the Natural History Museum with my classmates and we were sitting on the ground in a misshapen circle and we were supposed to ask questions to these band members on the balcony above us and when we were done asking questions they asked US questions and the first thing they asked was "what if MOP was for people of ALL talents. Would you approve?" and me and like 1 other person nodded<br>
5. I was on a field trip with my classmates and we were supposed to go into this dark room for like 10 minutes (and it's l like a really long room so you have to keep walking through it) and the teacher kept warning us "it's gonna get really dark, like PITCH black..." over and over again so we were kinda creeped out and everyone was huddling together and that's when I woke up</div><br>
I got &gt;9 hrs of sleep last night bruh<br>
<br>
Is it supposed to be 60 degrees at this time of year :concern:</div>

12/14/21<br>
1. My brother and I were trying to go somewhere but we were stuck near a lake in Columbia? (Like the country) And then I got really mad at him and scratched his finger and locked him in a closet (??) and felt really bad later. And then we did not continue the journey for fear that he would kill me<br>
2. My sister and I were making origami? (But the paper was long and rectangular, it was weird) We made a bunch of stuff and were designing a model of Chicago?? but then it all collapsed bc it was very heavy like we had put a very heavy helicopter on top of a chair or smth<br>
3. I was trying to run away from some evil blind lady (but she could see some stuff, it was weird) who was trying to kill me and I ended up running around and around the house, jumping out the window and then falling on some makeshift trampoline over and over again, I finally managed to lock her in the house<br>
4. I was taking my driver's test(??? at least I was driving around in circles) in this really cold place and I was also speaking Chinese(??), I kept getting 50%'s which is failing apparently and then ice started forming on the ground, which became really really slippery (but the temperature was like summer) so i got out of the car and started walking around, there were some kids on roller skates like wth and I soon got lost, after a while I came to a place that looked like the side of a boat but was actually a swing, basically a lot of middle schoolers (and my brother was there) hanging onto ropes tied to some bar and swinging back and forth above the icy water like 30 feet below, and every so often an adult would jump into the icy water they all looked like they were having a lot of fun it was crazy<br>
<br>
12/4/21<br>
1. tldr I failed the jmo<br>
So first the problems were all super ez and I solved all of them but procrastinated really badly on writing up sols<br>
But then the proctor gave me 3:30 instead of 4:30 so I hadn't written up ANY sols<br>
And then I had to beg for more time so when I finally got the 1 hr I was so nervous and barely wrote anything<br>
2. me and my siblings were going to an apartment  building-looking place where we could hear stories of kids around the world and some of them were really sad<br>
3. I was trying to bring a mouse home from school but it kept running away<br>
<br>
I dont seem to dream about aopsers/aops drama as much anymore (aka less interesting). Compared to my dreams a year ago:<br>
<br>
~11/06/2020 I was wandering around at hmmt and saw kevinmathz's team. I started yelling for mathicorn.<br>
<br>
~11/09/2020 I was at a summer camp in China and we were doing a puzzle hunt. I somehow had an old phone with letter buttons. I got a text saying<br>
"no one:<br>
kevinmathz: mathimathz"<br>
Then I turned around and showed it to mathicorn, who was right behind me.<br>
<br>
11/12/2020 We were all at hmmt and talking in the cncm discord server. We first joined a discord call at 5 am est, and then mathicorn was having a nervous breakdown. djmathman wrote a letter to mathicorn saying "Hi mathicorn, the HMMT organizers would love to have you and kevinmathz over. They love C&amp;P &amp; SS."</div><br>
<br>
Edit: It was almost exactly 2 years ago that I got shoved into reality by another aops mock contest, an aime, having flunked it despite thinking I had been generally doing the right thing :thinking:</div>

			<div class="message">My parents have always prohibited me from having playdates and hanging out with my classmates in general. (They've gotten less strict now, like if I asked to go to my friend's birthday party one of these days, they would say yes, but also be thinking, <i>"is she crazy?"</i>)<br>
<br>
I don't go to a very prestigious school- although it's a private school, literally no one really cares about math, and so in my parent's eyes, all of my classmates are just pieces of trash, and so were we if we copied them. They even went so far as to tell my brother and I about how most JMO qualifiers and MOPpers would not amount to much either because even though they are smart, they don't know what to do with their lives, but that's a different story. <span class="bbfont-three-q">(Am I one of those people?)</span><br>
<br>
I often cried in elementary school over the fact that my parents basically didn't allow me to have friends. When I came home talking about the new friends I made, my mom would say "do they like learning though?" or "they seem too <i>cool</i>". <i>Cool</i> basically meant popular, materialistic, and not caring about learning. I vehemently disagreed, because I thought my classmates were amazing, nice, people, and would grow up to be amazing people, but these repeated things kinda diminished my illustrious views of them. I eventually gave up on telling my family about my friends; in middle school I seldom mentioned the few friends that I had, and I currently have a small group of acquaintances (and like 1 person who maybe barely qualifies as a friend) but I just say I have no friends, because that is closer to the truth.<br>
<br>
But if I <i>had</i> had friends, and <i>had</i> spent time going to playdates and all the things little kids like to do, if my mom had <i>not</i> put all this effort into stamping out my desires to fit in with them, (which she succeeded in doing), would I have been obsessed with Frozen instead of perfect squares in 3rd grade? I probably wouldn't have officially became a nerd in 5th grade with my addiction to FTW. Even if I <i>had</i> been able to socialize with classmates and also have enough time for math, their influences would have sunk into me, and I would have developed with a very different mindset. Maybe I would have done math, but would I have believed all the things my parents convinced me of as a child, like that math and learning was <i>fun</i>? 6 years ago, I couldn't ignore the influences of my classmates like I can now. Would I have become one of the <i>cool</i> people? Yes, definitely.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until sometime in middle school that I realized my parents were pure geniuses for bringing me up this way (Well my mom did most of the work, my dad just thought of the ideas). They had literally sent me into the fire wearing a fire-proof suit.<br>
<br>
Many AoPSers probably have very different experiences as me, and probably also had very different school environments. There's another school district in the suburbs of my city, and a few AoPSers including Thangli05 go there. However, it's very far from my parents' work, and so we got sent to this private school instead. From 6th grade up until less than a year ago, I wished I lived there, because I knew a lot of people, from ARML practice and Mathcounts competitions, who went there. If I had gone to school with them, would my childhood have been much more fun? If my classmates <i>were</i> kids who liked math, (or at least they did it), my parents would have let me hang out with them?<br>
<br>
Maybe, but if they had, it's not clear that I would still have had protection from outside influence. Even semi-nerds like them, who keep up with at least some of the trends, would have changed me a lot, and shifted my focus away from math. Over time, as I have come to know more people around the country, the things I used to view as illustrious have shrunk by a lot, and now I can barely discern a difference between the people in that school district and my own school. The San Francisco Bay Area, on the other hand, is a very different story.<br>
<br>
I think it was actually a genius decision to send me to this <i>relatively worse</i> school, whether my parents realized it at the time or not. They portrayal of my classmates in a very dim light was justified because really no one at my school seriously cares about stem, and I was still able to find people like me through AoPS, which is online anyway.<br>
<br>
I don't think myself superior because of the way I was brought up; I just think these decisions made by my parents were optimal for my specific case. I can imagine that there are tons of successful people who grew up <i>with</i> friends, and thus social skills, and that is even more extraordinarily impressive.<br>
<br>
Yesterday my sister asked my mom if she could go to a friend's birthday party, and my mom replied politely, "don't you have enough time to play with them at school?" My brother and I locked eyes and almost started laughing- basically, neither of us had ever dared to ask such a thing; we knew it was no use because our parents would never say yes, and furthermore we would have received a few hours' lecture on how we should focus on learning instead of wasting time like that.<br>
<br>
Is my little sister growing up differently? Yes, definitely. My parents have gotten a lot less strict over the past decade, partly because they are much busier now and thus pay us a lot less attention. On the first day of 2nd grade she came home saying "I have 10 best friends!!" We were all kinda surprised, because imagine being popular. My dad, who is kinda an optimist, said "well that's good, then she has good social skills!!" (My brother and I dont have very good social skills.) My mom was more worried though, thinking that maybe the rate at which she, with the help of the environment in our house, is convincing my sister to cling onto math and science is slower than the rate at which her classmates are convincing her to pull away. I don't want to think about the breaking point, but I know it will be painful.<br>
<br>
My mom tells my brother every day to stop chatting with his school friends, and read a book, mainly to be a role model for my sister. I don't think it's helping that my sister sees me on discord the whole day. She probably thinks that if I chat with my online friends all day, she should get to hang out with friends too- it makes perfect sense. There aren't many things I can do to help my sister's future, but among them are directly teaching her math, helping to influence her using words, and wasting a little less time on discord, of which the last is by far the easiest.<br>
<br>
Edit: It's not that I think my sister is going the wrong way in life; she has some extremely useful skills like confidence and social skills, it's just that idt my parents think quite the same. But being good at math is not the only thing, and she will undoubtedly find a way to success later on. So, I'm mainly reflecting on the differences between me and my siblings' upbringings and I want to be as helpful as possible to them, and of course there is not one single path to success, there are a countless number.</div>

1. Tell your self that had u not made that mistake, u might've made a different one. That alternate universe in which u got the same ones correct AND didnt silly any of the ones u sillied might not actually exist<br>
2. Even if you did badly on this competition, you might do well on the next one, or the one after that- eventually, ur luck is gonna replenish. Not exactly karma, idk but somehow my contest performances seem like theres an equal balance of doing "badly" and doing "well", almost as if they balance each other out<br>
3. If you did okay (performed at ur skill level) and were a very tiny bit short of doing amazingly, think about if u actually deserved to do amazingly, since that is past ur skill level? I wouldn't want to get a 13 on aime from guessing 3 questions right, or getting EXTREMELY lucky- that just feels wrong, and then people would think i am at a way higher skill level than I actually am. It may look better to other people, but maybe its better for u mentally to get what u deserved than to get something higher and feel a little bit guilty.<br>
4. You're not the only one in this situation. Other ppl have the right to be salty too but they're not complaining (or maybe some of them are). There's no reason to go around ranting to everyone when they are in the exact same situation as you, or at least know what it feels like.</div>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">stuff</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">139.5 tentative (11111 11111 11101 11111 1111x) which is 22.5 more than 10a yay luck<br>
<br>
no idea what happened but this test definitely had WAY more geo and WAY less alg. maybe a lil more combo and less nt also.<br>
I thought this was very similar to the 2021 Feb 10a (my speed was almost exactly the same, and so was my distribution, I think I missed #15 and left #24 blank on that one). DEFINITELY way easier than the 2021 Nov 10a, I could tell even by the first few problems, but this is only my opinion and different ppl can have varying opinions based on which subjects they are good at soo<br>
<br>
favorite problem: #15 <img src="/assets/images/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":love:" title=":love:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
oh yea and #7 was rly hard I put 9 at first and then changed to 10, then 9, then 12 and then finally 11 in the last like 30 seconds not overcounting is hard<br>
<br>
also about 8 minutes from the end I realized I had forgotten to screenrecord (I usually screenrecord when I do online amc's) so i opened a screen recording extension that i had not used in months and pressed screenrecord<br>
and then the page started SCROLLING DOWN AUTOMATICALLY and i couldnt stop it I was literally having a heart attack cuz i thought the page would like close or smth but then it just produced a rly long picture of the entire page and nothing bad happened but i almost died there<br>
i hope i wont get dq'd for like breaking a rule :concern:</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">overview of amc10's</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">108 129 102 121.5 109.5 139.5 141 117 139.5<br>
well ig that was my last amc10 ever<br>
I feel like my childhood has ended<br>
ig i kinda peaked in 9th grade wrt computational :’)<br>
this is an okay note to end on and im pretty relieved, just not looking forward to amc 12 &lt;/3</div><br>
<br>
time to fail aime!!</div>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">spam thing i wrote like 4 days ago that u should absolutely not read</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">i did bad oops but not as bad as usemo; i think i was trying harder or smth<br>
so I went into my proctors office around 11:50 with my paper and pencil and eraser and chromebook (by the way my proctor is this old white guy who doesnt really know anything about math hes pretty nice tho) weird thing is I wasnt really nervous at all like I had absolutely 0 nervousness cuz i just cared that little cuz i knew i was gonna fail so i wasnt even gonna try and hype myself up just to be in pain for 4 hrs right<br>
so i was on discord while i waited for the problems cuz i thought they were going to be emailed to me but actually i had misread the instruction booklet and it said they shouldve been sent at 9 so then we got concerned cuz neither of us got the problems so my proctor called the maa like 5 times each time someone who knows nothing about the tstst picks up and says smth like "yeah ur registered for the amc next week" or "no ur not on the tstst list u should be disqualified" eventually someone sends ms. godberhan's email and she replies to my proctor and says he already got the problems and fsr it was in his trash folder so anyway I started at like 12:55. i kinda felt bad for my proctor tho cuz hes literally the dean of students and i had just made him spend an hr calling the MAA lmao (none of the other ppl at my school were available to proctor so he kinda just had to oops)<br>
and he doesnt nkow much about math competitions so he accidentally said some stuff like that ive taken the tstst b4 when it was the jmo not the tstst.. and at the beginning he didnt know the tstst had a name i dont blame him tho hes not a math person<br>
then at 4:24 i had basically finished p2 (darn my solution was so sketchy tho) except for the last part which i was bashing my head on, then i finally figured it out (but in literally the sketchiest way possible) and wrote it out. i skimmed over my p2 solution for about 3 seconds and decided not to check it because 1) im too lazy to ever check anything carefully, 2) i kinda wanted to let my proctor go home cuz he was kinda just boredly clicking on the computer and hes the literal head of students, and 3) how much more <i>could</i> get done in the remaining 45 minutes? so in the spur of the moment I said "i think im done" and then my proctor collects my papers and submits it (i hope he submitted it correctly)<br>
almost as soon as it ends i immediately felt huge regret for not taking more time if only i had spent like 3 minutes reading over my sols i mightve caught some typoes or smth? we dont get to keep our answer sheets but i always make typoes.. and if only i had spent maybe like 20 minutes on p3 i mightve gotten like 1 pt? not sure tho im trash at nt<br>
and then i check my email and see an email from my dad saying to take all the time whoops<br>
I definitely did not feel the ethereal feeling that i had felt when biking home after the aime in 8th grade and (mistakenly) thinking i had gotten ~10-11 <img src="/assets/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title=":roll:" class="bbcode_smiley"> probably cuz i was pretty salty at myself but i was also surprised that i had actually focused for like 3.75 hrs (well this is partly due to the fact that it was literally my ideal distrib GCx) so definitely shuld not get overconfident<br>
now watch me get back m yscore and have it be a 0</div><br>

			<div class="message">after mocking 1 amc (and doing pretty badly lol) i now have like 0 motivaton to do oly lmao<br>
especially bc there are no more fun geo units to do and algmanip is hard<br>
<img src="/assets/images/smilies/stretcher.gif" alt=":stretcher:" title=":stretcher:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
idk how long ill be able to survive doing otis without geo<br>
probably will eventually give up and attempt marabot again<br>
i realize maybe i should write down more stuff about my life (like the big things) or else I will forget what life was like now and when I was younger, i am already starting to forget, like mc nats I remembered clearly in like 2020 and its all blurred now<br>
but i can never find the time/motivation to do this :smiley:<br>
fortunately because my math teacher is unorganized and not very attentive ive already finished most of the work we do in class so i can now use math class as a study period which is moderately useful<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">what iS the most important time in one's life?</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">it probably differs from person to person but in a way, its technically high school.. first of all its the last time, for many people, that you interact closely with a very diverse environment there are no levels because everyone just goes to the same high school<br>
so in that way, you have the chance to spread your influence far, before everyone goes to different colleges and youre always with people kinda like yourself<br>
and then once you enter college your standing is pretty much based on what you have done in high school and your job is based on what you do in college etc<br>
<br>
so imo the most critical part of my life may likely be right now??<br>
<br>
either that, or elem school or smth like that because it determines ur view on life even earlier on etc etc but i wont go into that because its too sad and realistic to think that the time has already passed<br>
<br>
and if that is true then i am most definitely not taking the right approach i should be doing more math and not wasting time on instagram etc<br>
because although math is for fun and will exist forever, it only counts now and i cant go back and wish I had done more math and now is the only time in which my attitude towards math will determine my future<br>
hm maybe this is what asian parents think when pushing their kids to do math<br>
<br>
to think that i only have a few more years of this golden time, that is sad and disturbing..</div><br>
time to try to do computational and not get burned out &gt; : (</div>

			<div class="message">It was May 10th, 2019, I was in 7th grade, and school had just ended. I was so hyped for Mathcounts Nationals, the event I had dreamt of attending, ever since my parents first told me about it almost a decade ago, and I had been preparing for throughout the past few years. My mom and siblings had already left on a flight to Orlando, and my dad was working, so I had to walk 2 blocks from my school to CMU and sit on a bench in the CMU math department. I was about 4 foot 8 by the way, and had never really walked along a street with tons of college students, so I was a bit scared that I would mess up and fail my journey of 2 blocks.<br>
<br>
So I walked out one of the side exits of the school, but the lower school math teacher immediately noticed me, and was concerned that I would get lost. I told her that I was only going to CMU, which was 2 blocks away, but she turned me into the middle school office anyway. Oops, I thought, I should have gone out through the main entrance. After calling my dad, the middle school office agreed that I could walk 2 blocks by myself.<br>
<br>
I didn’t have a CMU ID card, because you had to be at least 13 to get a sponsored ID card, and I was 12, so I just hoped that I could sneak into CMU when a student opened the door. Thankfully, this ended up happening, and I sat down at a random bench in the math department and pretended to do homework, but I couldn’t get anticipation for tomorrow out of my head. CMU students, professors, and graduate students passed by and looked at me weirdly, including a very OP girl who is famous at CMU who my family called “sinosaurus girl” because she had made small dinosaurs shaped like sine waves. My dad found me at about 6 pm, and we ate dinner at a restaurant (one of the only times I’ve ever eaten at a restaurant), because my mom was not there to cook dinner. Once I got home, I quickly went on AoPS, packed my backpack, and went to bed. After thinking about Mathcounts for a while, I fell asleep.<br>
<br>
My dad and I left for the airport the next morning. My dad slept on the plane, but I was too excited and not tired at all. There wasn’t wifi though, so I spent all my time looking out the window and doing random things on my phone. When we arrived in Orlando and went to the shuttle area, my dad an I saw the Tennessee team, and a few people from other Mathcounts teams too. Everyone (students and parents) got on a shuttle bus, which contained more Mathcounts people, including one of the Video Challenge teams, Team Switcheroo Crew. I don’t know why, but I sat with Team Switcheroo Crew, and played cards with them on the bus.<br>
<br>
As the shuttle pulled over next to the Mathcounts hotel, I saw a girl standing next to the entrance with her mom and toddler sister. As I got off of the bus, they approached me and <b><b>WIStanford2004</b></b> told me that she was an 8th grader on the Wisconsin team, and she was very nice. Then since my team was not at the hotel yet, <b><b>WIStanford2004</b></b> and I wandered around a few floors of the hotel talking about stuff. My dad joined my mom and siblings, who were hanging around the hotel lobby and talking to other parents.<br>
<br>
I was with <b><b>WIStanford2004</b></b> on the 1st floor of the hotel, when I suddenly saw <b><b>HO-_-OH</b></b>, who I knew very well from FTW. I screamed “<b>HO-_-OH</b>!”. We didn’t know what to do, so <b><b>HO-_-OH</b></b>, <b><b>WIStanford2004</b></b>, and I walked around the hotel some more. We also talked about slapping <b>kootrapali</b> because he had called <b>HO-_-OH</b> a prostitute on FTW a few weeks earlier. I didn’t know what a prostitute was, and no one would tell me, so I had to google it myself later.<br>
<br>
<b>HO-_-OH</b>, <b>WIStanford2004</b>, and I walked around the hotel trying to find <b>PieAreSquared</b> and just looking for people in general, but trying to avoid <b>kootrapali</b>. We passed by the parents every now and then, who made us take pictures. We also tried to find <b>Thangli05</b>, who was on my team, but it looked like she hadn’t arrived yet. We actually found <b>PieAreSquared</b> after a while, who said hi and then went right to her room to do math. There were many outdoor pools, and <b>WIStanford2004</b> wanted to go swimming, but no one else had swimsuits. <b>HO-_-OH</b> and <b>WIStanford2004</b> dipped their feet into the water but I didn’t.<br>
<br>
We saw <b>SpinTop</b> and her team, and I screamed “Spinny!” <b>SpinTop</b>’s team leader was very nice and had given everyone on <b>SpinTop</b>’s team a lot of money, and was going to take them to Disneyworld.<br>
<br>
At around 3pm, the Pennsylvania team leader, who was kinda strict and had high expectations for us, arrived and gave me a plastic bag of Pennsylvania pins, along with my room card and other stuff. I don’t remember exactly which room I was in, but it was on the 4th floor around 407. After putting stuff in my room, I put my laptop (for playing FTW), paper and pen, and pins in a drawstring bag, even though my parents said it was a bad idea because the computer would break the bag. A lot of people already had their pins, so I met a ton of teams and traded about half of my pins away that afternoon. Before dinner I had a large variety of pins. I saw a few teams which I had met at the Mid-Atlantic Mathcounts Meet (it was basically a lot of east coast Mathcounts teams doing math for a weekend), such as New York. There were also a few teams busy practicing math, such as Montana and Texas. As I was walking around the hotel with <b>HO-_-OH</b>, <b>WIStanford2004</b>, and <b>SpinTop</b>, I randomly met a bunch of people including <b>Quacker88</b> and <b>wolfpack</b>, and traded pins with all of them.<br>
<br>
Then <b>HO-_-OH</b>, <b>WIStanford2004</b>, and <b>SpinTop</b> went to their rooms to unpack stuff, and I sat down somewhere on the 1st floor of the hotel and logged onto FTW on my laptop. I noticed a mass game with lots of people who were at Mathcounts Nationals, and I had no idea where they were. A while later, <b>Quacker88</b>, who was in a FTW game with me, suddenly appeared and asked me if I wanted to go to the computer room, which was where everyone else in the game was. I said no because I was shy and <strike>scared</strike>. But later I decided to play in the computer room, where there were a lot of people including <b>Eyed</b>, <b>wolfpack</b>, <b>friendlyguy</b>, etc. There were also plans to have a mass FTW game during the AoPS party on Monday.<br>
<br>
When I visited my room before dinner, I saw my roommate <b>deswimmer</b>. (I didn’t room with <b>Thangli05</b> because <b>Thangli05</b> was with her family.) <b>deswimmer</b> was often with her team, who liked to joke a lot, and it seemed like two of the boys liked to bully the third. I found <b>WIStanford2004</b> again and we visited <b>WIStanford2004</b>’s room, which was kinda messy. Her roommate was from Ohio. I also saw <b><b>aops_turtle</b></b> who was in 324, and she told us “if not for 18^2 I wouldn’t be able to remember it.” <b>WIStanford2004</b> and I randomly walked all over the hotel, and when we got out of the elevator on one of the floors, <b>kootrapali</b>’s team was in the lobby doing math, so we ran away, but at the same time we also wanted to stalk <b>kootrapali</b> for <b>HO-_-OH</b>. We met <b>YuhuanFluffyPillowPanda</b>, who I had seen on FTW 3 years ago, but had never known who she was. She was very nice. <b>YuhuanFluffyPillowPanda</b>’s teammates played pranks on each other, and <b>YuhuanFluffyPillowPanda</b> kept yelling at someone else on her team, who kept yelling back “what did I do”. I also saw <b>brianzjk</b> and <b>Trex4days</b>.<br>
<br>
At dinner, I sat at a table to the left pretty close to the doorway with <b>Thangli05</b> and people who I had just met, because I didn’t really know anyone else. I met <b>YuhuanFluffyPillowPanda</b>’s roommate, <b>WIStanford2004</b>’s roommate, and the rest of <b>SpinTop</b>’s team. During dinner, I looked around for more people I might know. My friends tried to find <b>kootrapali</b>’s team, which we did, and they were on the other side of the room. After dinner, my friends went upstairs to their rooms, and I walked around the tables with lots of other people, trading pins. I saw <b>goodball</b>, who I had become good friends with during the Mid-Atlantic Mathcounts Meet. A lot of teams were making their pins very expensive, such as Virginia (which had huge pins) and California (which was known for being very OP), in which price was something like 3 for 1. I bought 9 California pins and 7 Virginia pins, because I thought the prices might go up. (California did, but Virginia didn’t.)<br>
<br>
At about 8pm my team (<b>Thangli05</b>, <b>ImmaBear</b>, <b>skyguy88</b>, and I) had a meeting. The coach gave us a pep talk and told us to practice. I may or may not have been talking to <b>Thangli05</b> instead of listening though oops, because I hadn’t really practiced the whole day except for FTW; I had just been walking around with my friends. By the way, the coach had very high expectations for us and thought we would do well. “Hopefully 2 of you can make the Countdown Round” ~my coach. (I felt sorry for him afterwards.) Also the coach made us practice our stupid cheer which started with “We are the Champions From Pennsylvania” it was sooo cringy and we had to practice it outside the hotel because he made us shout really loud. The coach made up the cheer himself. I felt bad for the coach’s son, who was on the team. Throughout the whole meeting I was kinda just joking around with <b>Thangli05</b> instead of actually paying attention to the coach.<br>
<br>
It was almost time to sleep and there was a girls party with a lot of people. (I saw <b>Thangli05</b>’s sister <b>Jingli07</b> sitting on the floor) in <b>YuhuanFluffyPillowPanda</b> and her South Carolina teammate’s room or something, I forget which room. They were playing truth or dare. They wanted me to stay, but I ran away because I was scared of truth or dare. I went to my room and took a shower (my roommate was not there) and played a few games of FTW on my computer. People told me to go down to the lobby but I was too lazy to. I went to sleep at like 9:30 which was apparently late for me. I was trying to be a good kid. Idk why, I didn’t even think of pulling an all nighter. My roommate wasn’t back yet. (She was probably hanging out with her team.) I didn’t know at the time, but my room was like 2 doors away from <b>PieAreSquared</b> and her mom’s.<br>
<br>
I’m pretty sure I woke up around 7 am on Sunday morning and went downstairs to eat breakfast. None of my friends were there so I ate by myself. I saw <b>Puddles_Penguin</b> sitting nearby and went up to him and said “hi <b>Puddles_Penguin</b>” pretty loudly. <b>Puddles_Penguin</b> looked a bit annoyed at me for AoPS revealing him. After breakfast, I sat on one of the benches on the 1st floor of the hotel and played FTW on my laptop. I later went to the computer lab to play. I also visited my family, who were staying in a room on the 8th floor. I hadn’t visited them in a while. I kinda forgot it was mother’s day but my siblings reminded me. My family was very slightly irritated with me for spending all my time with friends and I was kinda sorry (but really not).<br>
<br>
It was soon time for the test but I wasn’t really scared at all (because I underestimated the difficulty of the competition and I was dumb and had a big ego, and also I didnt really care that much how well I did) I talked to <b>Thangli05</b> while we were waiting for the competition to start. <b>PieAreSquared</b> was like 3 feet away from me because Puerto Rico and Pennsylvania were adjacent. The boys on my team didn’t really talk, but one of them (<b>ImmaBear</b>) was being shipped with <b>Thangli05</b> and I didn’t know if it was real or not. (They were also hanging out together at Penn State ARML a month later so maybe.) I probably would’ve if I had played truth or dare though.<br>
<br>
Then it was time for the state cheers. My entire team was cringing because we hated our cheer, but our coach had made us do it. Some of the states had really good cheers and some were funny and Virginia’s was very inappropriate. I don’t remember much about the test, but after discussing with my friends and my team, I thought I had gotten a 17 on the sprint and 4 on the target (but I actually got 14 on the sprint and 4 on the target). I discussed the target round with <b>PieAreSquared</b> after each pair, and she seemed really worried. I felt bad for her because she probably had very strict parents who would be mad at her if she didn’t do amazingly.<br>
<br>
My team failed the team round really badly, and we were a bit scared that our coach would be mad at us, but we didn’t really care. Everyone was talking about what they got on the contest and was very concerned, but a few people such as <b>WIStanford2004</b> and I didn’t care (and I thought I would have next year so I wasn’t really serious about doing well.) I just hoped that I would be in the top 56. I didn’t know how hard that was though.<br>
<br>
After the rounds were over, we all got on buses to go to the Kennedy Space Center. I wasn’t exactly sure what was happening, but I ended up not being on the same bus as many of my friends. I sat next to <b>Thangli05</b> on the bus and chatted with her during lunch. We tried to write a blog post on my phone but there wasn’t wifi and I couldn’t waste mobile data. We stared at other people on the bus, especially the Guam team.<br>
<br>
When we got to the Kennedy Space Center, I found <b>WIStanford2004</b>, <b>HO-_-OH</b>, and <b>SpinTop</b>, and <b>Thangli05</b> and I walked around with them. We saw other states’ teams, and most states’ teams were together. I was pretty sure that <b>ImmaBear</b> and <b>skyguy88</b> were with our team leader. We waited in lines a lot, and visited a big auditorium, a big room with a space shuttle, and other stuff. I didn’t buy anything because I didn’t have any money.<br>
<br>
We saw the Kansas team eating ice cream, and <b>Thangli05</b> knew a lot of the people because she used to live in Kansas. We were waiting in line for something, when apparently it was time to go back. <b>HO-_-OH</b> was very scared of her team, because they made fun of her, especially one 8th grader who was apparently always texting his girlfriend. <b>CountTo100</b> was not too bad though. We saw her team so we ran away. I did not see my family though, even though they were somewhere around the Kennedy Space Center. When we were waiting at the exit, there was a big waterfall which splashed us, and lovebugs everywhere, which was kinda annoying.<br>
<br>
My coach wanted to go to Disneyworld (or Disneyland whatever) for dinner, so my team awkwardly followed our coach around Disneyworld. He made us take cringy pictures, and <b>Thangli05</b> and I talked the whole time. We ate dinner at a pizza place. When we were about to leave, <b>WIStanford2004</b> and <b>HO-_-OH</b> came to the pizza place too, and <b>Thangli05</b> and I asked the coach if we could stay with them. The coach agreed, and left with <b>ImmaBear</b> and <b>skyguy88</b>, so <b>Thangli05</b>, <b>WIStanford2004</b>, <b>HO-_-OH</b> and I talked for a long time while eating dinner at a table outside. Then we decided to go somewhere, but we didn’t know where, so after walking around for a long time and going into random buildings we went into a gift shop, but it happened that that <b>HO-_-OH</b>’s team was there buying stuffed animals, so we ran away. We almost got lost but somehow we got back to the hotel (I have no idea how.)<br>
<br>
Then <b>WIStanford2004</b> and <b>Thangli05</b> went to their rooms, and <b>HO-_-OH</b> and I played FTW in the computer room with some people. I ended up going to sleep around 10.<br>
<br>
At some point on either Sunday or Monday I saw my mother and siblings on the first floor of the hotel holding thundersticks. I showed them my pins and gave them some, as well as <b>luminescent</b>’s sister, who had made friends with my sister. <b>goodball</b> gave my brother a light up bracelet.<br>
<br>
After eating breakfast, all the teams had to go into a room, where we would get called to run into the awards ceremony room. While waiting, I snuck out my computer and played a game of FTW with <b>Eyed</b>, who was at a table nearby. When it was time to go in, I just awkwardly ran and waved my thundersticks because I wasn’t the one holding the banner. I didn’t notice my family because there were so many parents.<br>
<br>
The countdown round was hype as expected. I was rooting for <b>PieAreSquared</b> lol. I’m pretty sure we got our team results, and I had done worse than expected (81st). I was a bit sad, but I still thought that I had next year. My coach was a bit disappointed that we got 24th, which was really bad. (The top 23 teams were put on the final standings list oof.) I had like no pins left, but traded some of my 9 CA pins away for other states, since a bit of variety is good.<br>
<br>
People weren’t really eating lunch. My friends were at a table talking. We had pretty much given up on making <b>HO-_-OH</b> slap <b>kootrapali</b>, because <b>kootrapali</b> looked kinda shy, and we were extremely shy. We talked about how <b>kootrapali</b> talked a lot on FTW but not much in real life (but that was actually just because he was awkward around us), and we were also much more shy in real life.<br>
<br>
After lunch I played a bit of FTW, and then it was time for the Math Video Challenge, which was really OP. It was very obvious who would win- Team Switcharoo Crew. Of all my friends, I was like the only one who didn’t vote for the Math Video Challenge (the only reason why I didn’t was because it was Fortnite and idk) so I just voted something else random.<br>
<br>
Then it was time for the AoPS party, and I was hyped. We didn’t know where it would be, because we wanted to find a big room to fit like 50 people, but we hadn’t really thought about it, and so it ended up being in <b>goodball</b>’s room on the 7th floor, because <b>goodball</b>’s family had offered to use their room since it was very big. When my friends and I finally realized that, we went up and saw tons of people waiting in the hallway.<br>
<br>
The North Carolina team mentioned something about “[redacted]” and I was concerned. Someone told me that <b>Trex4days</b> and <b>brianzjk</b> had pulled a prank on me and changed <b>GeoPie</b>’s AoPS status. I did not know who <b>GeoPie</b> was, but I was kinda mad at <b>Trex4days</b> and <b>brianzjk</b>.<br>
<br>
Then we went into <b>goodball</b>’s room, and his ~3 year old sister slept through the entire AoPS party, which was extremely impressive. She was very cute. A lot of people made a huge mess of popcorn and candy, and I felt bad for <b>goodball</b>’s family who would have to clean it up. There was a big FTW game (by the way FLASH FTW still existed), and <b>PieAreSquared</b> and <b>HO-_-OH</b> together won a ton of games. We also talked about random stuff and the boys probably played other games. People were talking about what they got on Mathcounts states, and <b>friendlyguy</b> who was in 6th grade got 42. A lot of people had done well on the AMC 8, but I hadn’t. I avoided talking to or looking at <b>GeoPie</b>. Also, I thought <b>brianzjk</b> liked <b>YuhuanFluffyPillowPanda</b>, because he was talking to her a lot.<br>
<br>
At around 5, people started leaving to get ready for the Awards Ceremony and Banquet. At the end only a few people were left, including some people on the New York team (because <b>goodball</b> was on the New York team). We tried to clean up some of the popcorn so <b>goodball</b>’s family would not have to do all of it. <b>goodball</b> asked me if I ever got bullied for being short, because he did, and I said no, because usually people at my school are nice. I felt bad for <b>goodball</b>, who was like an inch taller than me.<br>
<br>
After the AoPS party I went to my room, put on my stupid dress and shoes that hurt after a while, and found my friends again. <b>aops_turtle</b> visited my room, and I was surprised, because <b>aops_turtle</b> is a god. My team took cringy pictures, and then my friends took a very cringy picture on the stage which I did not want. <b>SpinTop</b>’s team was all wearing black. We sat down at tables with two state teams each, and I think the Idaho team was at our table. My family was at a table very close by, so it was awkward. There was a slideshow with contestants’ photos and bios, and people were taking pictures of it. I took some pictures too, but the slides changed pretty fast. (I also lost my phone in August of that year so rip all the photos on it)<br>
<br>
There were a lot of speeches from scientists or engineers, and then the awards ceremony happened. Everyone was a bit sad, because Nationals was almost over. The very OP Massachussets team (<b>Boxcars2015</b>, <b>luminescent</b>, <b>DemonPlat4</b>, <b>westford_flying_fish</b>) won. My parents came up to me after it ended and told me to thank the organizers of Mathcounts, which I did. I also congratulated Team Swicharoo Crew.<br>
<br>
As I was going back to my room, <b>no_name</b> said hi to me. I went to my room, put on sneakers, and went into the computer room to play probably the last session of mass game FTW, since people would start leaving early the next morning. <b>HO-_-OH</b> was there too. People were asking me why I had not changed out of my dress, and it was because I was lazy. I’m pretty sure <b>HO-_-OH</b> gave me the password to her AoPS account, which I later forgot, and we may or may not have made multis. Then I left and went upstairs to my room.<br>
<br>
My roommate <b>deswimmer</b>’s team members were prank calling each other. She wanted me to talk to them, but I was too shy to prank call anyone. I checked AoPS, and <b>mathleticguyyy</b> was posting on my blog about people who hadn’t made Mathcounts Nationals. I knew that I was lucky to live in a non-pro state, or else I definitely wouldn’t have made Mathcounts Nationals, so I felt bad for smart people like <b>mathleticguyyy</b>. I quickly visited my family and then went to sleep around 10 pm.<br>
<br>
Tuesday was very sad because everyone was leaving. Some people left before breakfast, and the rest just walked around lonely. Some 8th graders were crying, because it was their last chance. I felt very lucky to be in 7th grade, but I was still extremely sad. I went to the computer room to play FTW, and a few people were there, but they soon left. A lot of AoPSers made a hangout where we could talk, even though Mathcounts Nationals was over.<br>
<br>
My team was among the last to leave. I packed up all of my stuff and found my family. I hadn’t packed much stuff, but there were so many gifts from the Mathcounts sponsors that they didn’t all fit in my backpack anymore. I didn’t want to talk much because I was very sad. I saw <b>goodball</b> just before I left, and he was almost crying. I hoped I would see these people again, but I didn’t know. (I did see a lot of them at 2019 ARML.)<br>
<br>
My mother and siblings were on a separate flight as my dad an I. At the airport, I saw the Colorado and Oregon teams. I thought about how I had missed a few days of school, but I thought I would be fine. My family flew to Los Angeles, California to see my grandparents (and miss a few more days of school). I did some homework, which was working on a Revolutionary War slideshow, and did some math with my siblings and grandparents.<br>
<br>
My mom was in a Wechat group with the Mathcounts Nationals parents, and had somehow found out about the [redacted] thing, and told me about it. I was really awkward and triggered, because I had to explain to her that it was a joke, and all made up by <b>brianzjk</b> and <b>Trex4days</b>. Apparently <b>GeoPie</b> had been crying because he had gotten into trouble, and I felt bad for him.<br>
<br>
I cried on Tuesday morning, because it finally hit me how much I missed Mathcounts Nationals.</div>

			<div class="message">hi<br>
so : D usemo : D day : D 1 : D was : D today : D and : D i : D failed : D ( like no cap i actually did )<br>
so i ate lunch and then started the test upstairs cuz its quieter there also harder to focus cuz theres no chair but i dont really focus well at home anyways. and i started doing some normal bs for #1 like normal right? and then i write on my paper "need row's avg &gt; column's avg" and i completel yforget what the problem statement even SAID just looked at that statement and then i spend the next HOUR finding the maximum number of cells whose row avg is &gt; their column avg like what the acutal heck am i high on.<br>
so then i get an ans of n(n-1) and dont catch the mistake at all<br>
and then i try to do some bs for #2 and find that n cant be odd etc and then after testing some values find that 6, 1, 2, 4, 8 work so i guess it's 6 and all the powers of 2, and i remembered this thing someone told me abt n^(2^n)+1 being prime, but i forget for which n, so i just assume its for all n (like thats how i remembered it) and so i think the answer is 6 and all powers of 2 and I procrastinate on this bs writeup until the last 10 minutes cuz : D<br>
so then its like 3pm and i go downstairs cuz its slightly quieter now but i very easily get distracted (not my familys fault, i always get distracted after 1.5-2 hrs of an olympiad) and start doodling and basically i do nothing for the next 2 hrs except for drawing a sht ton of bs diagrams for #3 and trying to disprove my suspicion based on my horribly drawn diagrams that O_1 = H_2 and O_2 = H_1. : D<br>
so for those 2 hrs i go back and forth between <i>kinda</i> working on #2 and <i>kinda</i> working on #3 and getting distracted and basically i get nowhere<br>
so at 5:10 there are 10 mins left and i realize i havent written anything for #2 yet so i absentmindedly write down what i think the answer is (and i cant recall what the Fermat Primes thing is called so i just say "its a theorem") and i am even so stupid as to forget to write why n cant be odd which is trivial.<br>
so i finish the contest thinking i got smth like 7/2/0 when i actually got like 0/0/0 how nice<br>
so i am trying very hard to not become depressed now (well thats an exaggeration cuz im literally smiling) but this is maybe my worst performance on one day of an olympiad so far it makes me doubt that what im doing is effective (is doing otis units even smth to be proud of if i cant even do a real olympiad?) (maybe I should not be so cocky about doing otis units because I am still uncapable of doing math and undeserving of this much respect) and ik i dont really focus on nonofficial things but usemo <b>is</b> official so i <b>should</b> have been focusing T_T and if i cant even do nonsht on usemo, there is no chance ima get nonzero on tstst<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">,</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">tbh idt i even deserve to take tstst LAWL :flushed:</div> and amc's gonna be a disaster too<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">fortunately im taking it at school but still</div><br>
and i can do better than this???????!??? T_T<br>
but also, if i only try and do decent on things that ACTUALLY count and bad on everything else cuz i am not motivated enough to try hard than ppl are gonna think im hella sus T_T<br>
so if i dont get lucky af on day 2 then well actually RIP my confidence<br>
and I dont want to put a ton of pressure on myself for day 2 but now i have to ;p<br>
well oops have to accept failure sometimes<br>
why is usemo a mouse<br>
dont feel like doing anything rn tho i <i>should</i> probably be doing otis</div>

			<div class="message">Oops im bored so I was just scrolling through aops blogroll<br>
This will just be a bunch of random thoughts because I don't know how to write<br>
The annoying thing abt this css is that the subject button doesn't show up on mobile so I have to delete the css and then paste it back in<br>
my mom is going on a trip this week so me and my siblings are gonna have to do stuff around the house so I'll have much less free time lol<br>
Bruh why are there lik 2 days until the amcs<br>
I haven't even started practicing oops<br>
I'm gonna take both 10s this yr bc I'm not confident that I can make usamo<br>
I will be taking the 10a in person at school which is good because I can focus better at school than at home and generally better in places I'm not used to<br>
I'm literally gonna burn myself out by mocking amcs in the week before the amc lol<br>
also theres tstst on nov 4 but idk if I'm supposed to take it like 70% sure and I don't want to think abt it because I simply cannot do tstst problems<br>
Also I don't think my brother is registered for the amcs, my parents don't know this, but I don't exactly want to remind him because he doesn't really like math and my parents just force him to do it and I don't really want to cause him pain like that and ive been bossy enough so far<br>
Why are there like 94736 things happening in the next 3 weeks<br>
Otis EV is weird like u either get the problem or u dont and so I've temporarily skipped a few problems because of this<br>
My sister has a very liberal 2nd grade teacher well that's not the right word but she encourages the kids to "be who they want to be" so like there are a few trans kids and a lot of the kids have changed their names or adopted nicknames that they prefer and my sister chose a nickname too my parents don't approve tho lol<br>
nanomath was nice but I got carried<br>
It got like 40 degrees colder in the past 3 weeks</div>

			<div class="message">Ok why am I writing a blog post on my phone in bed for the 928483th time<br>
Idk but I am better at writing late at night (well not better at writing just better at thinking of things to write about) and better at math in the morning<br>
Anyway this morning at like 2am apparently the security alarm went off in my house for like a whole 10 minutes? Or maybe more? And its super loud but I didn't wake up everyone else in my house woke up but not me LOL THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY CONCERNING LMAO IF THERE'S A FIRE AND I JUST LITERALLY DON'T WAKE UP-<br>
anyway this confirmed one of my worst fears, has addiction to alarms cuz of reaper killed my ability to wake up to alarms?? <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
Also my brother got in trouble at school for like hacking the school thing that doesn't let u visit websites so he could talk to his friend bruh the middle school has INSANE security now like the teachers can see EVERY SINGLE TAB YOURE ON DURING CLASS WHAT THE HECK it wasn't like that when I was in middle school lol<br>
<br>
Today was picture day so I just wore middle school uniform like I have for every single day so far of 10th grade<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">stuff that doesn't quite fit</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">The class of 2021.<br>
Idk why but I've had a weird obsession no not obsession more like admiration for the class of 2021 maybe it's cuz they're sufficiently older than me for me to actually respect and look up to them but not so much older that I barely know them at all<br>
Like I actually know quite a few ppl from that class from math classes throughout middle and lower school like honestly class of 2021 probably made up the biggest portion of my math classes throughout the years so I have a weird looking-up-to relationship with these people I barely know it's kinda weird I don't exactly know how to explain<br>
Also when I was in elementary school there was this group of ppl from class of 2021 who were really into math and they were on our schools mathcounts team and overall that class was relatively very into math unlike classes of 22/23/24 at my school<br>
But the reason why it's weird is bc it suddenly went from me being in 8th grade with like my math class being 75% class of 2021 to now where they are just like nonexistent and it's weird cuz they never really got a proper goodbye and now somehow class of 22 is seniors and they just seem too young/close to my age and its scary <img src="/assets/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":P" title=":P" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
Anyway I still can't get over how quickly class of 21 disappeared thank u covid<br>
<br>
9th grade.<br>
9th grade is weird af it's like ur in 8th grade which is so high up esp in my school where lower&amp;middle are in the same building ur like the "leaders of the whole building" etc etc and then u just go to high school and u are all smol again and I feel like 9th grade is so dang sheltered there's like very little choice in the classes u take, upperclassmen sometimes treat them as lower because they're newbies- and the workload is so dang tiny it's like if growing up is a running race 9th grade is sitting by the side of the road for an hour; a well deserved break<br>
Ok I know some schools may have a bigger workload for 9th grade but overall ur kinda treated as a baby/rookie by everyone else in the high school and it must be nice forgetting about getting old and responsibilities for a year and being able to walk around with bright eyes still able to soak up the newness and good parts of highschool<br>
Anyway it's just kinda weird and out of the ordinary cuz right after that year, high school speeds up like crazy and then college and I don't know if at any other point in ur life u get as nice and sweet a break, emotionally</div><br>
<br>
Also usamts r1 ended like just now and I probably completely failed because I basically bsed it in like 1 day and didn't even really check it cuz I'm too lazy oops bruh why are so many of this rounds questions like "find the exact number" I have terrible accuracy-</div>

			<div class="message">So uh I still haven't started usamts :concern:<br>
istg if there's some super hard combo problem that takes me a ton of time LIKE BASICALLY ALL OF THE ROUNDS LAST YEAR then I'm gonna die : D (no, I haven't looked at the problems yet)<br>
But I have to do nice rn and btw we're doing very badly on nice like I havent really checked any of my answers get and I'm desperately running out of time yayyyy<br>
Also tree math competiton was fun and totally genius format kinda like arml relay on steroids I got carried tho<br>
Team round was nice tho <strike>cuz I only did geo</strike> tbh team rounds are nice like that u often get to do only the subject(s) u like : D<br>
Oh and individual lets just say I'm absolute trash at computational<br>
Bruh homework sucks I have really been bs'ing way too many history readings because of bad time management and must not bs the one due tmr (but probably will)<br>
basically bs'ing means skimming the 15pg reading instead of reading it very SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AND TAKING NOTES yea according to the juniors u have to take very good notes to survive the ap exam because the teacher barely goes over anything in class (and I'm not brave enough to aSk AnYoNe FoR tHeIr nOtEs lmao : D)<br>
Anyway I'm very bad at taking notes<br>
Also I'm locked out of my otis account rn because I was very stupid and FORGOT TO ASK MY PARENTS TO PAY THE FOUR HUNDRRD AND EIGHTY DOLLARS but I will probably be spending the next week on usamts soo<br>
im also probably very behind on woot and otis practice exams<br>
anyway this week will be stressful yay</div>

			<div class="message">Oops I couldn't sleep<br>
<br>
Oops it's kinda wrong to have favorite teachers and they are all good this is just my opinion<br>
<br>
hs teacher I had for math in 8th grade:<br>
<br>
ok she was simply the best math teacher I had ever had I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY she was really good at explaining things though and always really confident and good at math AND SHE LIKED IT TOO and sports she was very athletic lol she was basically good at tons of things became my role model in like a few weeks<br>
She was also really good at talking to highschoolers almost as if she was a highschooler herself I initially thought she was like early mid 20s but after enough stalking I found she is actually in her 30s?<br>
But basically the main thing was she was extremely talented I used to have a stereotype for what ppl who were good at math and liked it were like but then this lady was a counterexample she literally looked like a normal cool person...<br>
Anyway she left for Connecticut right after 8th grade ended and I was very sad I wrote her a long email lmao and she didn't reply until a few days later I was literally PANICKING that I had said something bad by accident lol but she eventually replied and said she had printed out the email &lt;3<br>
ok but dang that math class was fun<br>
O yea and everyone else I know who has ever had her agrees she is best math teacher<br>
Anyway I looked up to this teacher a ton in 8th grade<br>
<br>
7th and 8th grade english teacher:<br>
<br>
ok she was extremely energetic despite being very short lmao<br>
But in a good way<br>
She taught us a lot and very effectively and she was an avid harry potter fan so we even did like a class competition in 8th grade based on harry potter it was so fun<br>
Also her class was really hard esp the essays the avg grade was like a B except somehow she always gave me decent grades even though my essays were often trash I think it's because I did extra membean which was like a vocab program that u have to do every week I just did it literally whenever I had free time (sometimes up to an hour a day) because I had literally nothing else to do<br>
So anyway that was nice of her &lt;3<br>
She was also kinda weirdo and wore these earrings shaped like life size cherries and I think she favored short weirdo kids which happens to be me x_x<br>
<br>
9th grade social studies teacher:<br>
<br>
ITS SUPER HARD TO TEACH CLASSES ON ZOOM if u actually wanna make it ENGAGING but somehow this teacher killed it<br>
She was super energetic esp in the mornings which was like the perfect way to get everyone awake also she acts very young even though she is a mom a single mom actually I just don't know how someone can be THAT INSANELY ENERGETIC while having so much to juggle and stress about<br>
And also she was always really happy. Some ppl I just don't know how they can find such a huge amount of happiness ALL THE TIME truly impressive<br>
<br>
Anyways ok bye<br>
Idk what this homecoming thing is cuz my school doesn't have it LMAO<br>
<br>
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT<br>
APPLY FOR ATHEMATH WINTER!!! EVEN IF U ARE KINDA SHAKY WITH THE PROBLEM SET!!!! ATHEMATH IS NOT SCARY!!! THE MORE APPLICATIONS THE BETTER :pray: PLZPLZPLZPLZ<br>
<br>
Sry for extremely long looking post I can't do hide tags on phone<br>
<br>
Also big announcement coming maybe tomorrow edit: not tomorrow oops its not completely done yet definitely in the next week tho</div>

			<div class="message">two high quality posts over 2 days? No way thats a personal record<br>
<br>
so yea since I bike home I decided to stay at school till rally started<br>
<br>
yea and then I saw the stuco removing the decorations that totally didn't fall from the wall due to using painters tape.<br>
<br>
Hmmm i'd say a significant other was there <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
Let's just say in a parallel universe I'd be asking her to hoco first<br>
<br>
totally had a not awkward conversation<br>
<br>
shouldn't have went up to her while she was with other friends<br>
<br>
who were uh<br>
<br>
upperclassmen<br>
<br>
so ya im an idiot<br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAplshelpAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</div><br>
anyways<br>
anyways<br>
<br>
met a few friends<br>
they asked me even if im not in the freshman stuco I could help them make their float<br>
<br>
so yea our float was basically our librarian's car (it is one of those highlanders that are 7 seat i think) with the wall decors put up and some balloons. Helped for a bit, saw the girl who I totally didn't have an awkward conv. with (luckily she didn't see me), had <img src="//latex.artofproblemsolving.com/a/d/2/ad2bac652ed768f65b0ded92233da4a7d7da7fcd.png" class="latex" alt="$\sum$" style="vertical-align: -8px" width="25" height="25"> pizza<br>
<br>
Then talked with someone from debate class also on the float decoration team (definently didn't brag my 4-0 dub), and gave her some tips.<br>
<br>
Finally everyone who was designing floats had to pass out candy (well not had to, but it was a competition, and your whole team needed to be walking with the float), and I found that there is this candy named "sugar daddy" was a thing. It was a lollipop. <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">.</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">why</div><br>
<br>
But yea though im not in stuco I was asked to go with them so y not<br>
<br>
Originally I planned to sit at the tailgate of the care (it was open cuz there were streamers), and so did few others, and we passed candy to the runners who gave it to the children who came from the elementary school near.<br>
<br>
Ye after 10 mins of delay it finally started. the tailgate was crowded so I HAD TO SIT ON A SPEAKER AT FULL VOLUME<br>
that was fun.<br>
<br>
After 2 minutes trying not to fall off the car while the speaker was blasting "roar" by katy perry (idk why people still use these songs during a rally in 2021) I decided to hang off the open tailgate, aka "stand" up on the trunk, hold what was connecting the tailgate to the car, and lean out.<br>
<br>
Was it dangerous? yes<br>
It started to rain so yea bad idea<br>
<br>
however it was cool  <img src="/assets/images/smilies/gleam.gif" alt=":gleam:" title=":gleam:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
except when the car was accelerating<br>
<br>
Threw some candy at the children that was fun as well all the children were literally having early trick or treat im jealous<br>
<br>
Did a few stunts like leaning to the right while one hand was holding to the connector- o and looking upside down and getting 5 seconds of motion sickness<br>
<br>
Ya until it started to actually pail - rip bonfire + fireworks<br>
<br>
ig im joining stuco cuz that was fun<br>
got a few good fundraising ideas as well<br>
<br>
anyways im too cool for this nerdy website filled with trolls gonna deactivate my account<br>

			<div class="message">almost 2 months into school wow<br>
<br>
so uh<br>
gotta lot of stuff to say<br>
<br>
My summer, in productivity was really bad. I did grind math here and then, but the rise of cncm smp got the best of me and ye I got addicted to it <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
However I did join a literal pro ftc team for robotics (6547- Cobalt Colts) (yes ig I just location revealed myself)<br>
<br>
But team 6547 is so good- they were in the winning team group back in like 2017 FOR WORLDS agjaepojahpoenbpoaneop, and every year they've been running for (this is their 5th year), they made worlds; or would have, due to covid. So yea this is gonna look really hot on my ec's since im basically guranteed worlds for the next 4 years- however I need to make sure im putting my part into the team, so thus im speedrunning java.<br>
<br>
So yea during the summer we did some outreach events, I spent my time building a sturdy af table using linear extrusion rods for a CNC(<strike>Spam</strike>) machine (yes we could have just bought a table but then again the coach wanted us to build from scratch so we can learn a lot from it, which I did). A few weeks ago the game rules released, so now we are building the robot, which is going well. The coach was nice enough to let me use the spare linear extrusion rods to build my trajectory machine for science olympiad- and let me just say its gonna be a literal monster thats gonna get us spots into the team <img src="/assets/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":D" title=":D" class="bbcode_smiley">. Picture is (hopefully) attached.<br>
<a href="https://postimages.org/" class="bbcode_url" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="bbcode_img" src="//cdn.artofproblemsolving.com/images/5/a/9/5a914e489986044c365cd57d573a528ce539f65f.png" alt="https://i.postimg.cc/rwWfVz7v/image.png"></a><br>
<br>
ik the event doesn't care abt how far you shoot it but it shoots a whopping <b>15 meters (50 ft)</b> which is crazy.<br>
<br>
Now I needed to replace the wood with another linear extrusion rod, so I can adjust how far it launches much easily, and lower the with of it, as the rod is bending cuz its too wide. Also have to add a locking mechanism. Note: I had to cut the aluminum myself and that was pretty much really cool.<br>
<br>
Also doing detector building (haven't started yet), and codebusters (have started already tho, going well)<br>
<br>
Oh yea also had my first debate comp two weeks ago-<br>
<br>
got 3-2, pretty nice for a first novice tourney, however not enough to land top 8 and get a medal. Lead Water Aff is so hard to debate against, but we held our ground<br>
<br>
Second week (last saturday actually)<br>
<br>
UNDEFEATED <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> yoooo<br>
like it was 4-0 (4 round tourney), and no, literally every team I debated against actually knew how to debate so this is shocking lol, especially for your second debate tournament<br>
<br>
Also I had to hear my gifted teacher telling me to do FBLA for like 15 minutes last Tuesday, so ig im in<br>
They have this "Introduction to Financial Math" which I pretty much won already<br>
<br>
Science Bowl hasn't started yet, however will do<br>
<br>
Have piano comp this wknd yet still not fully memorized ahhhhhh<br>
<br>
Hoco is this week, got a few things about it<br>
1. I wasn't able to secure a girlfriend so I ain't goin <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> <span class="bbfont-three-q">also my parents would disown me</span><br>
2. It seems there is a tradition that you decorate the hallways in your school every year during hoco week, and this year, the stuco reps from each grade USED PAINTERS TAPE to hold the wallpaper decorations. So what do you think happened?<br>
<br>
a) They've got some explaining to do to the janitors<br>
b) They need to take an art course along with an engineering course<br>
c) The wallpaper got stomped by about 1600 kids trying to go to their next class<br>
d) Another reason why stuco needs to be like other clubs and be supervised when they do these type of projects<br>
<br>
Sorry, the answer was e) all of the above. See the portion where I talk about standardized testing.<br>
<br>
3. We have to assemble on friday for a 80 minute long assembly in a possible 80 degree weather gym. <strike>I get to see cheerleaders tho</strike> JK<br>
<br>
4. There is this pep rally this wednesday and there is free pizza so im goin<br>
<br>
I have the PACT next week, which I didn't know existed so guess ima have to pull out the ACT Black Book and grind<br>
<br>
School:<br>
<br>
Currently have all A's in my classes <strike> not for long</strike><br>
Doing well in the college coding course (wait I have to do this week's homework tho, scanners are confusing)<br>
I get to roast the upperclassmen in my table in calc<br>
<br>
Speaking of calc yesterday we did this puzzle where the derivative of a function leads you to another card with the derivative and a new function, essentially the answer to one card leads you to another. We were supposed to do this by group but I wanted to speedrun (and also the girl at my table literally fell asleep- I drew amogus on her hand and was about to wake the heck out of her by playing something on my computer and plugging the headphones into her ear, but that failed cuz she woke up. Oops.), so I did. It took me 5 minutes, where it took the whole class half the period- HOWEVER I missed question one. <span style="color:#f00">187</span> My luck made me silly it, therefore meaning I missed every other problem. Rip. Luckily it wasn't for grade, and I could fix this by switching where I started (basically made the correct answer to the first problem the new first problem). don't compare it with an answer key tho.<br>
<br>
Physics is going well, learnt nootons 1st and 3rd law yesterday, but confused about this:<br>
<br>
If you are lowered by helicopter into a frictionless ice pond, with no horizontal motion, are you completely stuck? Can't you just lean forward and slide to the edge of the pond?<br>
<br>
Confusing<br>
<br>
<br>
Yooo this is becoming a high quality post I like it<br>
<br>
Math Comps:<br>
<br>
Recently started getting back into the grind. Hopefully not too late. These days due to school I have to push myself to do math. I usually haven't thought about this, but math is something I can continue doing in the background. Like even if I don't do any comp math in a day, I get back into it, without thinking I am losing motivation or smth else. However I can't motivate myself to finish doing EGMO lol, or doing something time consuming i.e. OTIS Apps. Do it for like a week but then stop doing it.<br>
<br>
Though in the past few months I feel like my interest in comp math has faded. Ig this is probably the addiction to video games I had over the summer, and the start of school. I used to post a lot on aops and be active, but over the past few months the average was literally going to aops blogrolls and viewing that for like 5 mins.<br>
<br>
The practice test I took got me a 90 on AMC 10 (originally thought the test had a leave blank option, so I added all the questions I didn't answer, turns out it already counted it rip) , while partly this was due for me having to stop at the 30 minute mark due to parental controls (bruh), did silly some of the early problems<br>
<br>
So give me some smexy math problems for me to do <img src="/assets/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" title=":)" class="bbcode_smiley"> prefer algebraic computational manipulations, still my fav<br>
<br>
also iabzcq if you are reading this (add her as a contrib so she can) hello, totally doesn't go to my school<br>
<br>
Anyways this took me a hour so im gonna ctrl enter after taking a pic of my catapult<br>
<br>
Lol there isn't a lotta days left before amcs and I already have a lot to do<br>
<br>

			<div class="message">Why is there like no time lol<br>
I don't even play sports or instruments I don't know how ppl handle this<br>
Lol I have an essay due tomorrow (at 8:15 am?) And I still have a ton of revisions to make so if I don't wake up before 6 I'm screwed<br>
Yep the procrastination has gotten to a point where I can't do most assignments until the day they're due because I just cannot find the motivation<br>
So yes I am barely scraping by with schoolwork : D but I know it will get wayyy harder soooooo<br>
About math... Progress on otis units has definitely slowed down a TON since summer. One day (9/17?) I had way too much homework (I went to bed at like 11 and woke up at 5) and just got too caught up in homework overload I kinda stopped doing math for a while and then attempted d induct but just had to give up because I wasn't ready for it yet anyway around 9/25 I switched to aimegeo and then did weird geo yeah im gonna just do all the rest of the geo units I have (maybe)<br>
Ok those few days when I was doing nothing felt horrible tho There's nothing worse than going to bed feeling like you haven't accomplished anything that day T_T<br>
otis and social media swallows up all my time so ig that's why I don't have time for anything T_T<br>
"Anything" as in stuff I have been hoping to do someday but never got around to lol<br>
Also my bike spontaneously got a flat tire today when I got to school it was fine but then sometime during the day it went completely flat it wasn't even a hot day it was pretty cool but anyways when I got out of the building it was literally completely flat either a pinch flat or someone stabbed it im hoping not the latter well it got fixed so it's alright<br>
Also my cousin Natalie was born on 10/1 now I have 3 cousins who are 2, 1, 0 wow I'm like a whole half generation older than them....<br>
My 7 yo sister wrapped a 6 pound weight in a blanket and is calling it her baby now<br>
O yea also I haven't played set since literally before school started I just don't have the time so rip my set skills I'm probably as good now as in February T_T<br>
ig for me set is a short term thing it's not a skill I'd ever be able to keep for a substantial amount of time<br>
Why is it that on Friday nights I'm sad that the schoolweek is ending (ok no kidding I do get pretty sad about this sometimes) and on Monday mornings I'm sad that the weekend is ending<br>
Why is it that I cannot think about 6th grade for more than 1 minute because too much nostalgia<br>

<li>its in the middle of middle school.</li>
<li>ppl arent completely disoriented and still in elementary schooler brains nor are they freaking out abt hs. its a very comparatively p e a c e f u l year imo</li>
<li>ur at that age where u can have relationships with teachers serious enough that theyre meaningful but not too serious that theyre distant.. and same with other classmates you dont consider your friends</li>
<li>ppl are very easily influenced like middle school is the time when u are first trying out stuff and if you are exposed to smth early on you can develop a very strong connection to it later</li>
<li>cliques are kinda a thing in that ppl know where they're oriented on the social compass but its not so strong that ppl stick to only their clique. ppl often float around and talk to everyone, hence the warm-ish environment. its like the last year or two in which you can really just go up to random ppl and say random things and not be judged too badly.</li>
<li>ppl dont care <i>too</i> much abt how they look (tho they do a bit), and prettyness is more on the inside than the outside</li>
<li>likewise, <i>you</i> dont have to care abt ur physical appearance that much</li>
<li>since u and ppl around u usually dont care too much about/desire relationships yet (this is a thing that comes with age), its possible to almost completely focus on your studies</li>
<li>u dont really have to worry about becoming an adult because you are fairly far from being one; at the same time you are not a child. your parents have not started to see you as a typical "annoying teenager" yet, at least hopefully they haven't.</li>
<li>there is not a huge workload, but you are still learning something (maybe).</li>
<li>so you get a lot of free time too.</li>
<li>since ur not just coming into middle school u dont have to worry abt being bullied for ignorance; you also don't have to to deal with the responsibilities, leadership, and independence that the 8th graders have as "upperclassmen". being in the middle is nice like that.<br>
<br>

age~11 to ~october 2020: youtube; this started because I played reaper (aka how everything bad starts) and was up for like multiple hours in the night and kept awake by watching youtube and scrolling through PiNtErEsT; it finally stopped when I banned myself from youtube around october 2020 it was smth like if I stopped watching youtube by then I could take a break from math from when I finished egmo to the end of 2020 (xD I didnt even finish egmo by 2020 :yaw:)<br>
may-november 2020: google hangouts until it went ded<br>
winter 2020-21: instagram reels (ok I felt like youtube -&gt; discord was an improvement because yknow like discord is math community and I certainly was not watching math videos on youtube but then instagram reels is a totally different story its like basically tiktok and I felt like if I got too much of that type of influence then I would go down the wrong path so I eventually quit<br>
but over time I get bored of things and want to explore other things <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley">)<br>
november 2020-present: discord<br>
oh wait and aops blogs was an everpresent addiction but not <i>that</i> serious cuz theres only so many blogs u can view<br>
<br>
ok I really really really want dont want to be addicted to youtube/instagram reels again D:<br>
but now im half addicted to instagram again lmfao<br>
<br>
gj to everyone not horribly addicted to social media <img src="/assets/images/smilies/notworthy.gif" alt=":omighty:" title=":omighty:" class="bbcode_smiley"></div><br>
the last few times I was in semi burnout it ended up lasting months &gt; : (<br>
consistency is most definitely better than grinding + doing nothing<br>
going to bed every day feeling like ive not really accomplished anything is pretty sad I think part of the reason I grind is for my mental health....................</div>

			<div class="message">sorry for such a dark start to this blog<br>
I should stop drawing attention to myself and this issue, I dont want u guys to worry about me, cuz im ok now<br>
thx for all ur thoughtful comments tho, they mean a lot and I really did not intend for ppl to write whole essays but wow thx<br>
<br>
anyways<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">life stuff</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">oops really long post lmao<br>
<br>
this whole past week has been weird since sunday ive done like no math at all cuz homework overload on monday, then i was just being lazy oops<br>
and also literally all of my unlocked otis units rn are D combo, B alg, and D weird geo/hybrid geo of which D combo looks like the easiest except now im literally dying loool<br>
but also i havent been able to wake up before 6 in like a week so ive been getting like &gt;8 hrs of sleep lmao (except for 1 day I slept midnight-5 bc of hw.....) but the problem is i used to do like 50% of my math before 6 soooooo <img src="/assets/images/smilies/no.gif" alt=":noo:" title=":noo:" class="bbcode_smiley"> but im tired af all the time (this certainly did not happen earlier) and have been half asleep in afternoon classes fsr :concern: its like my tiredness has an inverse relationship with lack of sleep wth<br>
and doing math at school is rly hard fsr like I cant focus D: and sometimes I cant even focus that well at home because im still distracted from school ??? help<br>
ig this is why i got so little math done in 2019..................<br>
ig its just SO EZ to get caught up in school and not have time for anything else ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br>
<br>
ig the only way to have more time for math is spending less time on social media LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>
yep obvious time management solution <img src="/assets/images/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":|" title=":|" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">other stuff abt school</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">so a lot of things are different compared to middle school. the classes are a lot more serious and less fun (ppl dont say stupid stuff in class and make everyone laugh and <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">the teachers dont seem that close to the students</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">like in ms, the teacher would just come up to u during class and start chatting LOL and there were some teachers we loved, now all the teachers just seem like meh<br>
maybe its just me<br>
but also only like 3 of my classes are with only my grade level so ig that could be why it doesnt feel that close</div>) and there are never those times when the teacher just like lets everyone do whatever they want or like if u finish the assignment early then u just get free time I MISS THOSE TIMES<br>
I think that is how I used to get all my hw done during school in 8th grade???????<br>
<br>
oh well ig this is just a rite of passage<br>
<br>
o yea and social stuff, <span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">just to get a sense of my grade</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">not to be racist there are like ~6 asian-americans 8 african-americans 4 latino-americans and ~60 ppl total so like mostly white vsco ppl, there are like 2 semi-nerds but theyre both boys... so I just hang out with (aka sit outside for the 1.5 hr long lunch break) this group of like 12 girls there are very few different groups of ppl to hang out with and I am like 5x nerdier than anyone else in the school so basically I have 2 options<br>
1. find a secluded spot in the school (unfortunately there r like none of these lol) and work on math whenever I can (aka the 1.5 hr long lunch break) and be a 100% social outcast<br>
2. actually sit with ppl during 1.5 hr long lunch break and listen to/participate in conversations but still be semi-socially distant because like I dont go to bday parties or anything; but then also get very little math done<br>
rn im like 30% 1 70% 2<br>
<br>
so I dont have any rly close friends but thats ok</div><br>
<br>
anyway I want to go back to middle school EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</div><br>
<br>
also athemath hmm<br>
im probably gonna screw up really badly (like I did in the demo class xD) but whatever <img src="/assets/images/smilies/thumbup.gif" alt=":thumbup:" title=":thumbup:" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">I had a pretty alarming dream last night</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">basically I wasnt able to do 112*192 at school.. I was having a massive brainfreeze or smth..<br>
then we were doing this scary ropes course at school  it was weird<br>
then some extremely haunting stuff abt slavery basically stuff u wouldnt want to think abt<br>
^i only remembered a few parts</div><br>
<br>
<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">quarantine</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">I think ppl have either done way more math or way less math. friends have either grown way closer or way farther apart. its like normal life but on 5x speed</div><br>

<span class="cmty-hide-heading faux-link" onclick="AoPS.Community.Utils.clickHide($(this));" href="#">sad stuff abt arml</span><div class="cmty-hide-content" style="display:none">my arml team has been like dying over quarantine <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
in the in-person practices there were always like at least 50 ppl who showed up (well there was also free pizza lmao) and even more than that at the start of the year because like ppl dropped out<br>
but this year the first practice was last week and there were literally 7 ppl in the varsity practice and 10 in jv its SO SAD<br>
and there used to be like a welcome picnic and it was just <i>much more social</i> ofc this is not possible because covid <img src="/assets/images/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":(" title=":(" class="bbcode_smiley"> its just kinda heartbreaking lmao<br>
and the community was really good too ig irl social interaction is just &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; online social interaction<br>
actually even last year which was all online the first practice had like at least 50 ppl in zoom idk what happened maybe the word did not spread enough but over the past year practices have been decreasing <img src="/assets/images/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":|" title=":|" class="bbcode_smiley"><br>
and the coaches are cmu students so theyre prob busy and dont have time for/know how to do outreach<br>
just hoping that when things are irl again it will go back to normal size...............<br>
<br>
<br>
sorry to end on a sad note</div></div></div>

			<div class="message">I dont usually delete stuff but I kinda had to after what happened a little over a week ago<br>
idk what I was thinking that day but I massively f'ed up and revealed my massive stupidity and destroyed the reputation, if any, that I had created over these past few years so I didnt really want to look at stuff from the past because that was all irrelevant now<br>
yea this is probably not the right way to deal with this situation but im really not sure what im supposed to do, nothing like this has really ever happened to me before (idk if u guys would know either cuz its most definitely not happened to any of u) so I just kinda quit talking in a lot of servers for a while<br>
but plz dont have pity or anything because I deserved this.. im really sorry for anyone who was a victim of my stupidity (basically everyone who knows what happened) and if it makes u feel any better ill say it was unintentional (well maybe that was obvious already) but youre probably going like "who the heck has that little common sense to unintentionally do such a thing" ok yeah im literally not sure. in the past I have done stuff to offend ppl and in the moment i somehow did not see how it was offensive, whether I should do it or not felt like 50/50. anyways, i definitely feel like this is a problem and need to become more socially aware somehow<br>
but ok ive learned a lot of lessons from this<br>
1. not acting impulsively<br>
2. to avoid sensitive topics in general<br>
3. another thing ive been thinking about, its kinda selfish of me to bring this up, but to what extent is it ok to forgive? in the past ive shown hate towards those ppl in the math community who have done bad things, because other ppl were also being hostile, and not forgiving was like "cool". im not talking about anyone in particular because this is a very general statement, but ppl follow those who are adamant and have strong opinions and charismatically emphasize their arguments towards ppl who disagree with them, and have a certain stubbornness that makes them not easily influentiable. generally in the math community, the "reasonable ppl" don't associate with certain ppl because of things they've done earlier in their lives, and forgiving them is just a stupid idea because the things they've done are out of the realm of forgiveness, and they'd likely just repeat the action again, and they need to learn their lesson at some point. but ive learned over and over again that ur supposed to forgive everyone for everything, at least eventually. yet i continued to set these ppl aside from ppl i'd want to interact with just so I could be.. socially accepted? but now ive been in that same situation, and im also one of those outcasts; I would definitely say I would like to be forgiven but thats only because of my own selfishness and I dont think the thing I did is something that can easily be forgiven and I deserved punishment not forgiveness. maybe forgivingness is more important than being socially accepted??<br>
so I definitely have some regret abt the things i did earlier.<br>
something else I realized is that theres a direct correlation between ppl who have done more bad things and ppl who forgive more easily, with the exception of some angelic ppl. anyway bruh gdi i was shook to death, this is gonna sound selfish af but like the first person who forgave me after doing the horrible thing was [redacted person who I had always thought as a bad person]. were they playing with my feelings? im often susceptible to things like these so probably. but anyway I was just completely stunned; it was as if the whole world was upside down and I had been wrong the entire time about everything and my interpretation of "bad" ppl was just completely warped and maybe badness goes hand in hand with forgivingness. I simply did not know what to say because I was still a bit wary of them since u cant exactly forgive someone of everything in a couple minutes and I still dont consider them a friend but I dont think I actively hate anyone anymore. but anyway, this definitely taught me to forgive, and im really sorry to everyone affected by the 9/11 attacks, basically everyone in the world, hopefully ill never do smth this bad again<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a ton of hw oops I somehow need to get an art project done by tmr and i havent started yet and the teacher literally assigns projects every few days and u cant just bs them aaaaaaaa<br>
